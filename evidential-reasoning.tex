%QUESTION: WILL THIS BE A "US CENTRIC" CHAPTER? I HATE THAT, BUT I AM AFRAID MY PART WILL BE US CENTRIC. 

\tableofcontents

\newpage

\noindent When a suspect appears in front of a criminal court, there is a high probability that he will be found guilty. 
%MDB [NOT SURE ABOUT THE DUTCH FIGURE BEING FIRST]
In the United States, statistics for recent years show that the conviction rate in federal courts is roughly 90\%, and in Japan reaches as high a rate as 99\%.\endnote{On the conviction 
rate in US federal courts, see the statistical reports of the Offices of the United States Attorneys, available at \url{www.justice.gov/usao/resources/annual-statistical-reports}. Most of these convictions are guilty pleas, not convictions after trial. On Japan's conviction rate, see \textit{White Paper on Crime 2014}, Part 2, Chapter 3, Section 1, available at \url{hakusyo1.moj.go.jp/en/63/nfm/mokuji.html}.} 
In the United Kingdom, the numbers are slightly lower, with a conviction rate of roughly 80\%, while in the Netherlands 
the conviction rate is around 90\%.\endnote{On the UK conviction rate, see \textit{Criminal Justice Statistics--March 2014}, available at

For the Netherlands, see CBS, the Dutch central bureau of statistics, publishing its data at \url{www.cbs.nl}.} 
This does not mean that the fact-finders deciding about the facts of a case have an easy job. Whether laypeople, such as jury members selected from the general public, or professionals, often experienced judges having completed postgraduate education, all face the difficulties associated with handling the evidence that is presented in court. What to do with conflicting testimonies? Does an established DNA match outweigh the testimony that the suspect was not seen at the crime scene? How to coherently interpret a large body of evidence? 
%What to do with illegally obtained evidence? %MDB [WE DO NOT ADDRESS THIS QUESTION IN THE TEXT, SO REMOVE?] 
When is there enough evidence to convict? % `beyond a reasonable doubt'? 

The primary aim of this chapter is to explain the nature of evidential reasoning, the characteristic difficulties encountered, and the tools to address these difficulties. 
Our focus is on evidential reasoning in criminal cases. There is an extensive scholarly literature on these topics, 
and it is a secondary aim of the chapter to provide readers the means to find their way in historical and ongoing debates. 
%MDB removed Before diving into the literature, 
%MDB [THE CHAPTER IS NOT EXACTLY LITERATURE FOCUSED, SO MAYBE "DIVIDING INTO THE TOPIC?"]

This chapter does not aim to offer legal practitioners, lawyers, judges and experts witnesses, practical tools that can 
be immediately used to better litigate a case. 
But we hope that 
practitioners interested in the theoretical underpinnings of  evidential reasoning in court  will benefit 
from reading this chapter. And, more generally, philosophers, legal scholars, statisticians, logicians and those scholars and practitioners 
interested in the theoretical aspects of reasoning with evidence 
will hopefully find this chapter an interesting resource 
and point of departure for further thinking on the matter.

%\subsection{Setting the stage: eyewitness testimony and DNA profiling}

\section{Setting the stage}

%MDB Moved from first part
%The fact-finders, lay jurors or professional judges, aim to reconstruct what has happened in the crime on the basis of the evidence. 
We set the stage by using two important and often encountered kinds of evidence as an illustration: eyewitness testimony and DNA profiling. 
%Similarities and differences between 
These two kinds of evidence will be used to establish a list of central questions that structure the exposition that follows.
%We will use two central types of evidence to develop a list of central questions associated with evidential reasoning: eyewitness testimony and DNA analysis.

\subsection{Eyewitness testimony}

Eyewitness testimony has always been a central source of information in criminal proceedings. It typically takes the form of 
oral statements by the witness in court, in response to questions by the prosecution, the defense, the court, and sometimes, albeit rarely, the jury. 
Eyewitness testimony can also come in the form of reports of oral 
examinations written in the pre-court stages of the criminal investigation. %, 
%normally by prosecuting officers and judges. 

Eyewitness testimony can provide information about what 
happened on the scene of the crime. Here is an example.
%
\begin{quote}
Q: Can you describe what happened that day?

A: I was in the park and suddenly heard a lot of noise, close by. I saw two men quarreling, shouting. Suddenly one of them pulled a gun, 
and I heard a shot. The other man fell to the ground. The shooter looked around, looked me in the eye, and then started to run.

Q: Can you describe the shooter?

A: He was a young men, in his twenties, I think. Tall, blonde, with a white skin, and unusually blue eyes. 
He looked unhealthy, with bad teeth, 
like a drug addict. He was wearing a perfectly ironed  shirt%MDB removed: an FC Groningen t-shirt
, which surprised me. %because he did not look like one who could afford it. 
%MDB removed: as we were in the Vondelpark. 
%MDB [THIS REFERENCES TO GRONINGEN AND VONDELPARK, WHILE GOOD TO ILLUSTRATE THE IDEA OF SPECIFICITY OF THE TESTIMONY, WILL BE OBSCURE TO MOST READERS]
\end{quote}
%
The information contained in the testimony can be 
more or less detailed, and on its basis the fact finders
can form a hypothesis about what happened. 
%Still, this remains a hypothesis. 
%On the basis of eyewitness testimony, we can form a hypothesis about what has happened. Sometimes, as in the example, the hypothesis contains specific detail---still it remains a hypothesis. 
%MDB [NOT SURE , STYLISTICALLY, ABOUT THE COMMA AFTER THE DASH ---,]
Still, it remains a hypothesis. There are many reasons why the hypothetical events reconstructed on the basis of the testimony might not be true. Typical reasons against the truth of the events reported by an eyewitness include that the witness wrongly interpreted what she saw, that time distorted her memories, or that the witness is lying.

%\subsection{DNA profiling}

\subsection{DNA Evidence}

DNA evidence has become very common 
in criminal cases. Perpetrators sometimes leave traces of 
themselves and their actions, such as, pieces 
of hair, skin tissues, drops of blood or other bodily fluids. 
By using forensic DNA technology, a genetic profile associated with the crime traces can be created, 
and if this profile matches with an individual's profile, this establishes a link, at least \textit{prima facie}, 
between the matching individual and the crime.


%DNA profiling has become an important tool in courts. The evidential relevance of a DNA profile stems from the fact that, although most of the structure of DNA is shared among all human beings (more than 99\%), the variations that do exist are specific for each individual. %DNA profiling has a strong scientific underpinning, and comes with precise statistical information.

But, what is a DNA profile? A DNA profile is determined by analyzing a number of specific locations, the so-called \textit{loci}, of a DNA molecule. %, 
%and establish the type of structure found there. The type of structure found at a locus is called an \textit{allele}. 
Different countries use different sets of %what are called 
\textit{core loci} for their DNA profiles. 
%MDB [TERMINOLOGY IS NOT EXPLAINED HERE. WHAT ARE LOCI? WHAT ARE ALLELES? TABLE TO BE ADDED MIGHT HELP. THE BUSINESS OF REPETITIONS IS NOT FULLY CLEAR] 
For instance, the CODIS system in the United States uses %13 core loci, to be expanded to 
20 core loci.\endnote{See \url{www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis}.} 
At each specific locus, a different \textit{allele} might occur. 
%Each locus is associated with different \textit{alleles} 
% which can be found at that location, where an allele differs from another because 
%of the number of repetitions of a small DNA sequence. 
%For instance, 
A core locus that is often used, called %in the profiles stored in forensic DNA databases in the United States 
CSF1PO, %This locus 
has up to 16 allele types, depending on how often the molecular sequence AGAT is repeated at that location.\endnote{See \url{www.cstl.nist.gov/strbase/str\_CSF1PO.htm}.} 
%MDB: removed %alleles 5, 6, 7 and then up to 16, 
A DNA profile, then, consists in a list of allele types for a certain number of select core loci. 


%DNA profiling has become an important tool in courts. 
The evidential relevance of a DNA profile stems from the fact that although most of the structure of the DNA molecule 
is shared among all human beings (more than 99\%), the select core loci used to construct DNA profiles are highly specific. 
To be sure, DNA profiles need not be unique, but their proportional frequency in a reference population is expected to be very low.
So, how is this low number arrived at?

Many countries have created extensive reference databases that contain million of DNA profiles,
%Each specific DNA profile is rare, and reference databases of profiles 
and these
are used to assess the rarity of a profile.  
%MDB: removed numerically measure 
%how rare a profile 
%MDB: removed really 
%is.
%MDB [NOT SURE IF THIS IS ABOUT HOW RARE PROFILES REALLY ARE, BUT IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT ESTIMATING RARITY ON THE BASIS OF VALID MODELS]. 
This is a two step process. First, the number of occurrences of each allele at each core locus in the reference database are counted.
This gives a measure of the proportional frequency of each allele at each core locus in the population. Second, the measured proportional 
frequencies for the alleles at the core loci are 
multiplied. This allows us to assess the overall proportional frequency of the DNA profile, or to use a more common terminology, 
the \textit{Random Match Probability}. More recently, the terminology \textit{Conditional Genotype Probability} 
has also been introduced. %\endnote{Some special care is needed to accommodate for the fact that an allele can be from either part of the double helix that comprises our DNA.} 
%These Random Match Probabilities are the numbers reported by forensic experts in courts. %, and the smaller they are, the higher the evidential value of the profile is taken to be.
The sets of core loci have been chosen such that Random Match Probabilities, or Conditional Genotype Probabilities,
are typically small, for instance, in the order of 1 in 50 billion, amply exceeding the number of people on our planet. 
%The use of more loci leads to smaller Random Match Probabilities. 

There is discussion about whether we can reasonably 
affirm such low numbers and if it makes sense to report them. 
A key assumption underlying the model---used when multiplying the measured proportional frequencies of specific alleles---is that there are no 
dependencies among the alleles at different loci in the population considered. This assumption does not always hold, for instance, in a population 
with family relations. Scientists have also established certain dependencies among the profiles within ethnic groups. 
Testing the independence assumption can be hard, and would require the assessment of more profiles than reasonably possible. 
 %The problem is that
% We have virtually no means to study the robustness of such small numbers.
%MDB [BUT I THINK THERE IS LITERATURE THAT HAS TESTED THE INDEPENDENCE ASSUMPTION. DO WE MENTION IT? BUCKLETON BOOK?]

With this background in place, suppose now that a trace of blood---which allegedly came from the perpetrator---is found at the crime scene, and that the DNA profile created from the trace matches 
the DNA profile of a suspect. The match
%the fact finders can form
lends support to the hypothesis that the suspect---as opposed to an unknown individual---is the source of the blood trace, and the Random Match Probability associated with the profile provides 
a measure of the evidential strength of the match. %It is a common misunderstanding to equate this number with the probability that the suspect is not the source of the trace. 
%This well-known misunderstanding is referred to as the prosecutor's fallacy. The probability that the suspect is not the source of the trace can only be determined from the Random Match Probability, after considering the prior odds that the suspect is the source. 
%MDB [IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE TO TALK ABOUT PROSECUTOR'S FALLACY? TOO EARLY? TOO MUCH INFORMATION?]
Importantly, the hypothesis that a DNA 
match can support is rather circumscribed. It is limited to the suspect being the \textit{source} of the trace and 
should not be confused with the hypothesis that the suspect is \textit{factually guilty}, at least 
absent other information about how the trace got there.\endnote{We use the terms `factually guilty' or simply 
`guilty' to express factual guilt, which is not the same as the legal verdict of guilt.} 
Further, given the declared match, the hypothesis itself that the suspect is the source 
need not be true. We should always be wary 
of possible laboratory errors and false positive matches. 
And even if no laboratory error occurs, the suspect and the perpetrator, while different individuals, might share 
the same DNA profile, either because they are identical twins or because, though unrelated, 
they happen to share the same profile by sheer coincidence.\endnote{At a rate of a dozen or more twin births per 1000 live births, identical twins are not that rare.

\subsection{Central questions}

Using the two kinds of evidence as an illustration, we now provide 
a list of central questions about evidential reasoning in the law. 
These questions will structure the discussion that follows.

%\textit{Question 1:	How should we handle conflicting evidence?}
\textit{Question 1:	How should we understand conflicts between pieces of evidence?}
Legal disputes often occur because 
the evidence provides conflicting perspectives on the crime. For instance, a witness claims that the criminal has blond hair, 
but the suspect whose DNA matches the traces at the crime scene, has dark hair. %What to do in case of such conflicts? 
How should we understand conflicts between pieces of evidence? What are the different 
ways in which such conflicts arise?
%MDB [NOT SURE THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF THIS QUESTION IS ENHANCED BY THE TWO LONG EXAMPLES OF DNA AND EYEWITNESS EVIDENCE PROVIDED EARLIER. THIS QUESTION IS INTELLIGIBLE IN ITSELF, ONLY WITH THE AID OF THE TWO BRIEF EXAMPLES THAT ACCOMPANY IT.]

\textit{Question 2:	How should we handle the strength of the evidence?}
Some evidence is stronger than other evidence. This is most obvious in the case of DNA evidence, where DNA profiles are associated with different Random Match Probabilities or Conditinal Genotype Probabilities. But also some eyewitness testimonies are stronger than others. For instance, the description of a criminal by a witness who could only view the crime scene in bad lighting conditions, is of lesser value. How to address the strength of evidence?
%MDB [WE LATER CALL THIS "VALUE" OF THE EVIDENCE, NOT STRENGTH, RIGHT?]

\textit{Question 3:	How should we coherently interpret the available evidence?}
A DNA match can support the claim that the suspect is the source, and a witness can add information about how the crime was committed. In general, there is a lot of evidence that needs to be coherently combined in order to make sense of what has happened. How do we combine all information in a coherent whole?

\begin{comment}
\textit{Question 4:	How should we collect, include, exclude evidence?}
During the collection of evidence all kinds of things can happen. A witness' answer to a question can be discarded when the prosecution's question is judged to have lead the witness to an unjustified position. The classic example is the question ``When did you start hitting your wife?'' before it has been established that the suspect has been hitting his wife in the first place. Also DNA material can have been collected illegally, for instance without the suspect's consent. Which rules exist that guide the collection, marshaling, inclusion and exclusion of the evidence?
\end{comment}

%MDB [ALL IN ALL, IT SEEMS ALL THESE QUESTIONS DO NOT NEED THE EARLIER EXAMPLES. MAYBE THE LONG EARLIER EXAMPLES CAN BE MADE SHORTER?]

\textit{Question 4:	How should we decide about the facts given the evidence? When are we done?}
After a careful and exhaustive investigation in the pretrial and trial phases of the criminal proceedings, the question arises when a decision can be made and what that decision is. When is the burden of proof met? 
What is ``proof beyond a reasonable doubt''? %When have we collected enough evidence to make a decision?

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
The plan is as follows. In the next section (Section~\ref{sec:frameworks}), we discuss three normative frameworks 
that can help us understand how to correctly handle the evidence. %They are based on arguments, 
%scenarios and probabilities. 
In the remaining sections, we discuss the four questions we set out above in light of the three frameworks  and their 
distinctive features (Sections~\ref{sec:conf},~\ref{sec:str},~\ref{sec:cohint} and~\ref{sec:whenconv}). 
%The final question (Section~\ref{sec:whenconv}) ties together the previous ones and concerns the decision to convict or acquit after evaluating the evidence.




\section{Three normative frameworks}
\label{sec:frameworks}

In this section, we discuss in broad 
outline three normative frameworks for the assessment of the evidence presented in a case: 
arguments; probabilities; and scenarios.  Those frameworks 
constitute systematic and well-regulated 
methods for examining, analyzing and weighing the evidence. %the handling of the evidence: 
%~\citep{andersonEtal2005,kapteinEtal2009,dawidEtal2011}. 
In this section, we shall only briefly 
emphasize their distinctive theoretical strengths. Arguments can naturally 
capture the dialogical dimension, by modeling relations of support and attack. These are the issues raised by the first question above 
about conflicting pieces of evidence.  Probabilities are better suited to quantify the value of the evidence. 
This is the issue raised by the second question about different pieces of evidence having different strengths. 
Finally, scenarios are best in offering a coherent and holistic interpretation 
of large bodies of evidence. These are the issues raised by the third question 
above about combing different pieces of evidence in a coherent whole. 
Neither framework, by itself, is well suited to address the 
fourth question about reaching a decision on the basis of the evidence. 
As we shall see toward the end, each framework will have 
to be supplemented with a decision-theoretic component. 






% The first framework discussed uses arguments as primary tool, 
%the second scenarios, and the third probabilities. 
%MDB [SHOULD WE MOTIVATE WHY THREE FRAMEWORKS? ONCE YOU SAID IT IS CONTROVERSIAL THAT THERE ARE ONLY THREE.]

\subsection{Arguments}

The first normative framework %for the handling of evidence 
that we discuss uses arguments as its primary tool. 
Arguments are best analyzed in a dialogical setting, for they 
contain reasons that \textit{support} or \textit{attack} a certain conclusion of interest. For instance, when a witness reports that 
she saw the suspect at the crime scene, this evidence constitutes a reason for the conclusion that 
the suspect was, in fact, at the crime scene. But if the DNA profile found at the crime scene 
does not match the suspect's DNA profile, this constitutes 
a reason attacking the conclusion. An argument with a supporting and 
an attacking reason is represented in Figure~\ref{fig:arg}.

\begin{figure}[bt]
\centering
\input{img/argument}
\caption{Arguments with supporting and attacking reasons\label{fig:arg}}
\end{figure}


The analysis of the structure of arguments goes back to the early twentieth century when John Henry \citet{wigmore1913} developed his famous evidence charts. The work by the New Evidence Scholarship~\citep{andersonEtal2005} continued from Wigmore's insights. Independently, and not focusing on evidence in criminal cases, the structure of arguments for and against conclusions was formalized and studied  computationally by the philosopher John~\citet{pollock1987,pollock1995}. Pollock's work stimulated an extensive literature on the formal and computational study of arguments~\citep{vanEemerenEtal2014ch11}.


\subsection{Probabilities}
\label{sec:normfram:prob}
The second normative framework %for the correct handling of the evidence 
uses probabilities as its primary tool. 
In handling evidence in court, a crucial question from the probabilistic perspective is, 
how probable is a certain hypothesis $H$ given a body of evidence $E$? This is 
the \textit{conditional probability} of $H$ given $E$, or in symbols, $\Pr(H|E)$. 
Another crucial question is, how does the probability of $H$ 
change in light of evidence $E$? This \textit{probability change} is expressed by 
the difference between the so-called posterior probability $\Pr(H|E)$ and prior 
probability $\Pr(H)$.
%\endnote{ \label{footnote:prior} The language of `priors' and `posteriors' probabilities is standard. It suggests a temporal ordering, although these probabilities are all assigned at the same time; they are not temporally ordered. Contrast this with \textit{Bayesian updating} which is the controversial epistemological thesis that the probability $\Pr(H)$ of $H$ \textit{after} considering evidence $E$ at a certain time $t_2$ must be equivalent to the conditional probability $\Pr(H|E)$ assigned at an earlier time $t_1$.} 
Both questions can be addressed with 
the famous Bayes' theorem:
%
\begin{quotation}
	$\Pr(H|E) = \dfrac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E)}\cdot\Pr(H)$.
\end{quotation}
%
%<<<<<<< HEAD
%This formula---which can be easily proven from 
%the probability axioms---shows how the 
%conditional probability $\Pr(H|E)$ of hypothesis $H$ given evidence $E$ 
%can be computed by the prior probability $\Pr(H)$ and the 
%factor $\Pr(E|H)/\Pr(E)$. 
%\noindent One of the lessons of Bayes' theorem is that the more surprising 
%=======
This formula---which can be easily proven from 
the probability axioms---shows how the 
posterior probability $\Pr(H|E)$ of hypothesis $H$ given evidence $E$ 
can be computed by the prior probability $\Pr(H)$ and the 
factor $\Pr(E|H)/\Pr(E)$.\endnote{Bayes' theorem can be derived using the definition of conditional probability. 
We have $\Pr(E|H) = \Pr(H\land E)/\Pr(H)$. Here we use logical conjunction $\land$ to write the combined event $H$ and $E$. 
Hence, $\Pr(H\land E)=\Pr(E|H)\cdot \Pr(H)$. It follows that
$\Pr(H|E) = \Pr(H \land E)/\Pr(E) = \Pr(E|H)\cdot \Pr(H)/\Pr(E)$, proving Bayes' theorem. Note that the theorem holds generally for probability 
functions and does not assume a temporal ordering of taking evidence 
into account, as instead suggested by the terminology of `prior' and `posterior' probability. 
This terminology is standard in the context of Bayesian updating.}




%\endnote{The language of prior and posterior probability is standard 
%in the legal literature, but is misleading. The prior and posterior probabilities are not temporally ordered. The former is $\Pr(H)$  and the latter is
%$\Pr(H | E)$. Such probability assignments exist \textit{at the same time} and their values 
%are determined by Bayes' theorem. The language of prior and posterior probabilities make sense in the context of \textit{Bayesian conditioning}, that is, the claim 
%that if one begins with prior probability assignment $\Pr_0$ about $H$, $\Pr_0(H)$, and one acquires new evidence $E$  about $H$, 
%then rationality requires that one transform one's prior to generate posterior probability assignment $P_1$ about $H$ by conditionalizing on $E$, 
%that is, $\Pr_1(H) = \Pr_0(H | E)$, where $\Pr_0(H | E )$ is determined using Bayes' theorem. \label{conditioning} See \cite{bovensEtAl2003}.} 

%One of the lessons of Bayes' theorem is that the more surprising 
%>>>>>>> origin/master
%the evidence---that is, the lower $\Pr(E)$---the higher the probability 
%of the hypothesis given the evidence and the larger the probability increase. 
%To illustrate, compare two DNA profiles, one with a Random Match Probability of 1 in 10 and the other with 
%a Random Match Probability of 1 in 1 million. It is more surprising---that is, less probable---to find a match 
%for the latter than the former profile. Suppose now a genetic match is found between 
%the crime traces and a suspect. The hypothesis that the suspect is the source 
%of the traces is more probable (or the probability increase more pronounced) 
%if the matching profile has a lower Random Match Probability.

%To illustrate, suppose a trace is found at the crime scene 
%rare DNA profile of estimated frequency, or Random Match Probability, 1 in a billion. 
%and forensic analysis shows 
%that the suspect's DNA profile matches the crime trace. 
%Let $M$ be the match and $S$ the hypothesis that the suspect 
%is the source of the crime trace. The crucial questions, from a probabilistic standpoint, are: 
%How probable is the hypothesis $S$ given evidence $M$, that is, $\Pr(S|M)$? And, 
%how does the evidence $M$ change the prior probability of $S$?
%In the sections that follow, we shall see to what extent these questions 
%can be addressed with the tools of probability. In particular, 
%we shall see how the probabilistic framework can take 
%into account the numerical part of DNA evidence, what we earlier described as the 
%Random Match Probability. 

%By Bayes' theorem, 
%
%\begin{quotation}
%	$\Pr(\neg S|M) = \dfrac{\Pr(M|\neg S)}{\Pr(M)}\cdot\Pr(\neg S)$
%\end{quotation}
%
%We cannot easily assign a number to the priopr probability 
%$\Pr(S)$ or Bayes' factor $\Pr(M|S)/\Pr(M)$ probabilities. Thus, 
%the value of $\Pr(H|M)$ cannot be determined straightforwardly. 
%Still, we know the matching profile is rare; item Random Match 
%Probability is 1in a billion, so 
%
%\begin{quotation}
%	$\Pr(M) = 1/10^9$
%\end{quotation}
 %a match is not often found accidentally. 
%This statement can be made precise in the probability calculus. When $E$ expresses the evidence that the suspect's profile matches the trace's and $H$ that the suspect is not the source, we write:

%\noindent Here $\Pr(E|H)$ denotes the conditional probability that the suspect's profile matches the trace's, given the condition that the suspect is not the source.

%MDB [THE TREATMENT OF BAYES THEOREM IS BRIEF AND IT'S UNCLEAR HOW IT IS CONNECTED WITH THE RANDOM MATCH PROBABILITY.]


The interest in probabilistic calculations as a tool for the good handling of the evidence has recently been stimulated by the statistics related to DNA profiling, and by some infamous miscarriages of justice that involved statistics, in particular the Lucia de Berk and Sally Clark cases~\citep{dawidEtal2011,fenton2011,schnepsColmez2013}. The interest is not new~\citep{finkelsteinFairley1970, tillers2011}, and can in fact be traced back to early 
developments of probability theory~\citep{bernoulli1713, laplace1814} and forensic science in the late nineteenth century~\citep{taroniEtal1998}. To what extent probabilistic calculations have a place in courts has always been, and remains, the subject of debate \citep{tribe1971, fentonetAl2016}.

% \endnote{A recent instance of the debate concerns the R v T case, where the UK Court of Appeal restricted the use of Bayes' theorem in courts to cases with a solid statistical foundation such as DNA; see the 2012 special issue of Law, Probability and Risk; Vol. 4, No. 2. For a 1970s instance of the debate, see~\citet{finkelsteinFairley1970,tribe1971}.}

\subsection{Scenarios}
\label{sec:introScen}
Finally, the third normative framework %for the correct handling of the evidence 
centers around scenario analysis. In a scenario, a coherent account of what may have happened in a case is made explicit. %Different scenarios are contrasted, and evaluated, by considering their plausibility and by checking to what extent they match and contradict the available evidence. 
Scenario analysis proves helpful when considering a complex case and its evidence. 
For instance, the following brief scenario can help to make sense of a murder case:
%
\begin{description}
	\item The robber killed the victim when caught during a robbery but lost a handkerchief. 	
\end{description}
%
\noindent This scenario can make sense of a number of facts, for example, that no one in the victim's circle of acquaintances 
is a possible suspect; that there are signs someone broke into the victim's apartment; and that a handkerchief 
was found on the floor although it does not belong to the victim. 
Such a unifying explanation in the form of
a scenario can be regarded as a sense-making tool for handling 
cases with a large dossier. 
%
%\begin{comment}
%For instance, consider a murder case in which a . An interpretation of what happened: 
%%with two suspects: the victim's former partner and a robber. For each suspect, a scenario is considered that explains the murder:
%
%\begin{description}
	%\item $S_1$: The victim's former partner killed the victim after a fight.
	%\item $S_2$: The robber killed the victim when caught during a robbery.	
%\end{description}

%When the robber confesses having killed the victim during a robbery, there is evidence contradicting scenario $S_1$ and matching scenario $S_2$.
%\end{comment}


Legal psychology has contributed to our knowledge about the role of scenarios in handling the evidence~\citep{bennettFeldman1981,penningtonHastie1993}. 
Scenario analysis is also connected with inference to the best explanation~\citep{pardoAllen2008}.
Scenarios, however, 
can be misleading. Experiments have shown that a false scenario told in a sensible chronological order can be more persuasive 
than a true scenario whose events are told in a random order. Still, the legal psychologists~\citet{wagenaarEtal1993} have
emphasized the usefulness of scenario analysis for the rational handling of the evidence. In their work, they use scenario analysis for 
debunking dubious case decisions.

\section{Conflicting evidence}
\label{sec:conf}
 	
%\paragraph{Evidential reasoning in the law is a dialectical process involving reasons pro and con different reconstructions of the facts.} 

In many situations, it is clear what the facts are. In a standard case of tax evasion, for example, 
it will be easy to establish whether you filed for taxes on time and whether your employer paid you 100,000 dollars in 2015. Only in special circumstances, 
such as administrative errors, there will be something to dispute here. 
But cases that are litigated in court are typically more complicated.
Disputes emerge because the two parties---who then become the defense and the 
prosecution in a criminal trial---introduce evidence that support conflicting 
reconstructions of the facts. In this section, we illustrate how 
each of the three frameworks can represent and model conflicts 
between different pieces of evidence. 



%For example, a witness for the prosecutor may assert she saw the 
%defendant around the crime scene at the time of the crime, 
%while the defense may introduce evidence that the genetic material found 
%at the crime scene does not match the defendant's.


\subsection{Arguments}
\label{sec:confArg}


In the argument-based framework, conflicting evidence is analyzed 
in terms of reasons for and against a certain conclusion. Consider a crime case, where a witness testifies she saw the 
suspect at the crime scene. The witness testimony constitutes a reason supporting the conclusion 
that the suspect indeed was at the crime scene. This can be understood as 
an argument \textit{from} `a witness testified she saw the suspect at the crime scene' \textit{to} 
`the suspect was in fact at the crime scene'.
This argument consists of three parts: the conclusion; the reason (also called the premise); and the connection between the reason and the conclusion.
%More precisely, different kinds of attacking reasons can be distinguished. 
%Consider again the argument for the conclusion that the suspect was at the crime scene, supported by a witness reporting that she saw the suspect at the crime scene (Figure~\ref{fig:arg3}, on the left). 
%Each of these three parts can be attacked. %This argument can be attacked in three ways. 
In what follows, we describe three ways 
this argument can be attacked and three symmetric 
ways the same argument can be further supported by additional reasons. 


\paragraph{Three kinds of attack can be distinguished: rebutting, undercutting and undermining.}

Consider the argument that the suspect was at the crime scene because the witness reports that she saw the suspect at the crime scene. 
First, the conclusion can be attacked. %The suspect can for instance have an \textit{alibi}, 
%showing that he was not at the crime scene. 
For example, suppose DNA testing shows that the suspect does not genetically match 
with the traces found at the crime scene. 
Such an attacking reason is called a \textit{rebutting attack}. 
It supports the opposite conclusion, namely that the suspect was \textit{not} 
at the crime scene. 
%
Second, the reason itself can be attacked. 
 For instance, %when the witness report is fraudulent, this is a reason for believing the witness did not report 
 if the witness never actually testified that she saw the suspect at the crime scene, this attacks the existence of the supporting reason itself. 
 %content of the witness testimony was misunderstood---for example, because the testimony was provided through a translation---this is a reason for 
 %doubting the witness actually testified she saw the suspect at the crime scene. 
 This kind of attack is referred to as \textit{undermining attack}. 
%
Third, the connection between the reason and the conclusion can be attacked.
 The fact that the lighting conditions were bad when the witness saw the crime, 
 is an example of such an attack, referred to as an \textit{undercutting attack}.
 % The lying of a witness is an example of such an attack, referred to as an \textit{undercutting attack}. 
 In contrast with a rebutting attack, an undercutting attack provides no support for the opposite conclusion. In the example, %when the witness is lying, 
 if the lighting conditions were bad, there would be no reason explicitly 
 supporting that the suspect was not at the crime scene. 
%The attacking reason, % statement, %here the lying of the witness, 
 %here the bad lighting conditions, is also referred to as an exclusionary reason. 
%
The three examples of the different kinds of attack are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:arg3}.

\begin{figure}[bt]
\centering
\input{img/argument3}
\caption{Three kinds of attack\label{fig:arg3}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Three kinds of support can be distinguished: multiple, subordinated and coordinated.}

%I put attacking reasons first and then further supports second, because the further support seems a response to the there attacks

Just as attacking reasons can target the conclusion of an argument, its supporting
reason or the connection between the two, additional reasons 
can provide further support for each of these parts. %Having in mind a dialogical setting for analyzing the structure of arguments, 
Additional reasons can be seen as responses to attacking reasons or as reasons strengthening an existing argument. 

Consider, once again, the argument that the suspect was at the crime scene because the witness reports that she saw the suspect at the crime scene. 
First, the conclusion can be further supported, for example, by a second witness testimony. 
If a conclusion is supported by more than one reason, this is referred 
to as \textit{multiple support}. 
%
Second, the reason itself can be supported, for example, 
by a video recording of the witness testimony itself. 
Support of the reason itself is called \textit{subordinating support}. 
%MDB isn't this subordinating support simply a case of "chaining"
%
Finally, the connection between the reason and the conclusion can be further supported, for example, 
by another testimony that the witness has always been trustworthy and reliable. 
Support for the connection between the reason and the conclusion does not have a standard name, but is closely related 
to a third named kind of support: \textit{coordinated support}. In coordinated support, the support for the conclusion consists of at least 
two supporting reasons which, in their conjunctive combination, provide support for the conclusion. Coordinated support is distinguished from multiple support because in the latter each supporting reason 
provides support for the conclusion by itself. 
%

Figure~\ref{fig:support} shows the three kinds of (further) support. Multiple and subordinated support are graphically visualized with an arrow, whereas coordinated support is shown with a line. An arrow indicates the unnamed kind of support of the connection between reason and conclusion.

%MDB INTERESTING DISTINCTIONS BUT THE TERMINOLOGY IS HEAVY AND SOMEWHAT CONFUSING. CAN WE MAKE THIS SHORTER?

%\paragraph{The arguments for and against different positions have structure, involving complexes of reasons supporting and attacking positions.} MDB changed
\paragraph{Arguments can involve complex structures of supporting and attacking reasons.} 

So far we have looked at an elementary argument, consisting of a reason and a conclusion, along with three types 
of attacking reasons and three types of symmetric supporting reasons. But an argument can also be more complex, 
for example, it can contain \textit{chains of reasons}. 

Consider, once again, the example of a witness who reports that she saw the suspect at the crime scene. The witness testimony constitutes a 
reason supporting the conclusion that the suspect was at the crime scene, and this conclusion---in turn---functions as a reason 
that supports the conclusion that the suspect committed the crime. This chain of supporting reasons 
is graphically depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:arg2}, on the left. 
Attacking reasons can also be chained. For example, when it is discovered that the witness is a member of a rivaling gang, 
this constitutes a reason for concluding that the witness has an interest in lying, and further, for concluding 
that the witness is in fact lying (Figure~\ref{fig:arg2}, on the right). This conclusion attacks---undercuts, to be precise---the connection 
between the witness testimony and the conclusion the suspect was at the crime scene.

\begin{figure}[bt]

\input{img/argument2}
\caption{Supporting and attacking reasons can be chained. \label{fig:arg2}}
\end{figure}





%\paragraph{In an argumentative dialogue, parties take positions supported by reasons that can be challenged by attacking reasons.}
%
%Arguments have a dialogical counterpart, in which parties exchange reasons for and against the positions they endorse. The arguments shown in Figure~\ref{fig:arg2} for instance form the backbone of the following argumentative dialogue---here presented as a fictitious, stylized discussion between judge, prosecution and defense:
%
%\begin{description}
	%\item \emph{Prosecution}: The suspect committed the crime.
	%\item \emph{Judge}: Why do you believe that?
	%\item \emph{Prosecution}: The suspect was at the crime scene.
	%\item \emph{Judge}: Do you have evidence supporting that position?
	%\item \emph{Prosecution}: There is a witness reporting that she saw the suspect at the crime scene.
	%\item \emph{Defense}: Objection, your honor! The witness is lying.
	%\item \emph{Judge}: Why do you believe that?
	%\item \emph{Defense}: The witness is a member of a rivalling gang.
%\end{description}
%
%
%
%[I LIKE VERY MUCH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE THREE KINDS OF ATTACKS AND THE GRAPHICAL ILLUSTRATION. BUT THIS PART ABOUT THE DIALOGUE IS STRANGE. 
%FIRST, THE DIALOGUE IS UNNATURAL. SECOND, I AM NOT SURE THIS IS ABOUT ARGUMENTS ANYMORE. ARGUMENTS CAN COME IN THE FORM OF A DIALOGUE 
%BUT NEED NOT BE. PERHAPS WE NEED TO REDEFINE THE ARGUMENT FRAMEWORK AS DIALOGUE/ARGUMENT FRAMEWORK?]

\subsection{Scenarios}

In the scenario-based framework, conflicts 
are analyzed by considering different scenarios about what may have happened. While in the previous framework, conflicts were 
modeled as conflicts between attacking and supporting reasons within arguments, 
here the perspective is more holistic, and conflicts 
are modeled as conflicts between scenarios.

 \paragraph{There may be conflicting scenarios about what has happened.} 
The prosecution and the defense sometimes present different scenarios 
about what happened. In a murder case, for example, prosecution and defense 
may put forward the following conflicting scenarios:
%
\begin{description}
	\item $S_1$: The defendant killed the victim when caught during a robbery.
	\item $S_2$: The victim's partner killed the victim after a violent fight between the two.
	%\item $S_2$: The defendant was at home with his wife.	
\end{description}
%
The two scenarios conflict insofar as they offer 
incompatible reconstructions of the killing 
and point to two different perpetrators.

At trial, however, while the prosecutor is expected to identify the perpetrator, the defense is not expected 
to identify another perpetrator. % other than the defendant. 
Two scenarios, then, can be conflicting 
even though they do not each point to a different perpetrator, such as the following:
%
\begin{description}
	\item $S_1$: The defendant killed the victim when caught during a robbery.
	%\item $S_2$: The victim's former partner killed the victim after a violent fight between the two.
	\item $S_3$: The defendant was at home with his wife.	
\end{description}
%
Scenarios $S_1$ and $S_3$ are still clearly in conflict because they cannot be both true. 
Still, scenario $S_3$ does not say who killed the victim or how the crime occurred. 
It only asserts, in the form of an \textit{alibi}, that the defendant did not do it.
%Here the conflict is connected to the different sides, prosecution and defence. 


\paragraph{Evidence can be explained by one scenario, but not by another.} 
Conflicts between scenarios can also exist in relation to the evidence, for example, when one scenario 
can explain a piece of evidence but the other cannot. Two senses of `explanation' are relevant here. First, 
a scenario explains the evidence in the sense that it \textit{predicts} the evidence. If the 
scenario is assumed to be true, the evidence must be (likely to be) there. 
There is another, albeit closely related, sense of explanation. 
A scenario explains the evidence in the sense that it exhibits the \textit{causal process} by which the evidence 
was brought about. 

%This applies most naturally to physical and testimonial evidence. 
%In a case in which traces were found at the crime scene, 
%it is more plausible that an individual visited the crime scene 
%and left the traces by physical contact.

To understand the difference between the two senses of explanation, consider the conflicting scenarios $S_1$ and $S_2$, one referring 
to the robber scenario and the other to the partner scenario described above. 
%Both scenarios explain the starting point of the murder investigation: the victim's body found at the crime scene (evidence $E_2$), in the sense that finding the body is expected assuming either scenario to be true. 
Suppose now that laboratory analyses find a genetic match between the DNA profile of a tissue trace found under 
the victim's fingernails and her partner, and it is clear that the skin tissue could not have gotten there unless there was 
a violent fight between the two. Scenario $S_1$, the robber scenario, cannot explain the presence of the trace matching the victim's 
partner. Scenario $S_2$, the partner scenario, can explain the presence of the matching trace. The explanation is that the victim's partner is the 
source of the trace, which was deposited during the violent fight between the two. The scenario can predict 
the presence of the trace, in the sense that if the scenario is assumed to be true, the matching trace must be there or 
likely to be there. The scenario also exhibits the causal process that brought about the trace, namely the violent fight, altercation 
and physical contact between the two. 

However, suppose another piece of evidence 
is that the victim's house was in fact robbed in concomitance with the victim's death. 
Scenario $S_1$ can explain this evidence, both in terms of prediction and in terms of causal 
process. By contrast, scenario $S_2$ cannot offer the same explanation. 
 All in all, scenarios $S_1$ and $S_2$ 
are not only inconsistent on their face, they also diverge
in terms of the evidence that they can or cannot explain.

\paragraph{Scenarios can be contradicted by evidence.} So far we considered scenarios that are 
inconsistent with one another because 
they cannot be both true, and also scenarios that diverge in terms of 
the evidence they can or cannot explain. There is another type of conflict worth discussing. This takes the form of 
a quasi-inconsistency between scenarios and evidence. The quasi-inconsistency occurs 
when the evidence taken at face value---typically testimonial, not physical evidence---asserts 
that such-and-such an event occurred, while the scenario 
denies precisely that. 

%Just as there can be conflict between scenarios considered \textit{per se}, 
%there can be conflicts between scenarios and the evidence presented. 
Suppose a video recording shows the defendant 
breaking into the victim's house, and upon being discovered, 
killing the victim and later stealing the jewelry. 
This evidence contradicts scenario $S_2$ 
in which the victim's partner is the killer. More precisely, insofar as the evidence 
is taken at face value---that is, the video is taken to be truthful---scenario $S_2$ 
is inconsistent with the evidence, while scenario $S_1$ is consistent. 


\begin{comment}
%By assuming the truth of the scenario, the presence of the evidence can be derived more or less deductively. 
This can expressed by the statement \textit{if} $S$, \textit{then} $e$, 
where $S$ is a scenario and $e$ the evidence, in the sense that $e$ 
follows deductively from $S$. The relation of prediction can also be probabilistic, in the sense that given the truth of the scenario, 
the truth of the evidence is highly probable. 
%In the language of probability, the conditional probability $\Pr(E|H)$ of $e$ given $S$ can also be used, where the higher the probability, the better 
%the scenario's predictive power relative to the evidence. 
For example, let $V$ be a scenario that comprises the event that the defendant visited the crime scene, and let $M$ be 
evidence that certain genetic material matching the defendant 
was found at the crime scene. Clear $V$ predicts $M$, in the sense that from the truth of $V$
 the match $M$ follows almost deductively or at least with a high probability. 
%If a scenario can predict the evidence, this fact favors the scenario, and if it cannot, this weakens the credibility of the scenario.

There is another sense of explanation that deserves mentioning here. 
A scenario explains the evidence in the sense it exhibits the \textit{causal process} by which the evidence 
was brought about. This applies most naturally to physical and testimonial evidence. 
In a case in which traces were found at the crime scene, 
it is more plausible that an individual visited the crime scene 
and left the traces by physical contact. Here the scenario exhibits the causal process (physical contact) 
by which the existence of the evidence 
(traces) was brought about.

\subsection{Probabilities}

In the probability-based framework, conflicts are modeled as conflicts between pieces 
of evidence which support or attack a certain hypothesis, where `support' 
and `attack' are described in probabilistic terms. 

\paragraph{Support can be characterized as ``probability increase'' or ``positive likelihood ratio''.} 
%BV:I changed difference to relevance, as 'prob diff' is used later for something else.
%BV:I prefer replacing 'favoring and disfavoring' by 'suport ad attack', throughout. MDB: DONE
%MDB : used the expression "probability changes" because relevant is general and might apply also to a likelihood ratio greater than one. 
A piece of evidence $E$ supports an 
hypothesis $H$ whenever $E$ raises the probability of $H$, or in symbols, 
$\Pr(H|E) > \Pr(H)$. 
For example, a witness 
testifies that she saw the defendant around the crime scene
 at the time of the crime. The testimony supports the hypothesis 
 that the defendant is factually guilty. 
This can be described probabilistically, as follows:
 %
 \[ \Pr(\textit{guilt}|\textit{testimony}) > \Pr(\textit{guilt}).\] 
 %

\noindent There is another characterization of evidential support. 
Instead of comparing the initial probability $\Pr(H)$ and the probability $\Pr(H|E)$ 
of the hypothesis given the evidence, a so-called likelihood ratio of 
the form ${\Pr(E| H)}/{\Pr(E |\neg H)}$ 
%BV: I changed the vertical fraction to a horizontal one. Looks better inline. I prefer that everywhere.
can also be used.
On this account, $E$ supports $H$ whenever the likelihood ratio ${\Pr(E| H)}/{\Pr(E |\neg H)}$
%$\frac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E | \neg H)}$ 
is greater than one. This means that the presence of the 
evidence is regarded as more probable %BV was 'likely'
if the hypothesis is true than if the hypothesis is false. Given the example considered earlier, we have:
%
 \[\frac{\Pr(\textit{testimony}|\textit{guilt})}{\Pr(\textit{testimony}|\neg \textit{guilt})} > 1.\]
%
These two characterizations of evidential support---in terms of probability 
increase and positive likelihood ratio---are 
in fact equivalent. For the following statements hold:
%
%\[\textit{\text{$E$ favors (or supports) $H$} iff }  P(H|E)> P(H) \textit{ iff }\frac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E|\neg H)}>1.\]
\[ \Pr(H|E)> P(H) \text{ iff }\frac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E|\neg H)}>1.\endnote{To see why, recall that 
%
\[ \frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H | E)} = \frac{\Pr(E | H)}{\Pr(E| \neg H)}\cdot \frac{\Pr(H)}{\Pr(\neg H)},\]
%
%BV The LR formula should be in the main text somewhere
%BV I like having this proof. (Source?)
%BV I don't like a long, complex footnote. Let's discuss.
which implies
%
\[\frac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E|\neg H)}>1 \text{ iff } \frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H | E)} > \frac{\Pr(H)}{\Pr(\neg H)}.\]
%
For one direction, if $\Pr(H|E)> P(H)$, then $1- \Pr(H|E)< 1- \Pr(H)$. This means that 
$\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{1- \Pr(H | E)} > \frac{\Pr(H)}{1- \Pr(H)}$, and thus
$\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H | E)} > \frac{\Pr(H)}{\Pr(\neg H)}$. So, by the equivalence above, $\frac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E|\neg H)}>1$.
For the other direction, if $\frac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E|\neg H)}>1$, then $\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H | E)} > \frac{\Pr(H)}{\Pr(\neg H)}$, again 
by the equivalence above. 
The latter is the same as $\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{1- \Pr(H | E)} > \frac{\Pr(H)}{1- \Pr(H)}$. To establish $\Pr(H|E)> \Pr(H)$, suppose for contradiction that
$\Pr(H|E) \leq \Pr(H)$, which implies $1- \Pr(H|E) \geq 1- \Pr(H)$. This means that $\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{1- \Pr(H | E)} \leq \frac{\Pr(H)}{1- \Pr(H)}$. 
This contradicts $\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{1- \Pr(H | E)} > \frac{\Pr(H)}{1- \Pr(H)}$, and thus $\Pr(H|E)> \Pr(H)$.}\]
%
The equivalence, however, only holds if the two hypotheses 
being compared in the likelihood ratio are one 
the negation of the other, such as \textit{guilt} and $\neg$\textit{guilt}.


 
% \paragraph{Two characterizations of evidential favoring and disfavoring are equivalent} 
\paragraph{Attack can be characterized as ``probability decrease'' or ``negative likelihood ratio''.} 

By contrast, a piece of evidence $E$ attacks a hypothesis $H$ whenever $E$ lowers 
the probability of $H$, or in symbols, $\Pr(H|E) < \Pr(H)$.
For example, if a DNA test shows no match between the traces found at the crime
 scene and the defendant, this evidence attacks the hypothesis that 
 the defendant is factually guilty. 
 Probabilistically, 
%
\[ \Pr(\textit{guilt}|\textit{no DNA match}) < \Pr(\textit{guilt}).\] 
%

\noindent Similarly, a piece of evidence $E$ attacks a hypothesis $H$ whenever 
the likelihood ratio is lower than one. This means that the presence of the evidence is less probable %BV was 'likely'
if the hypothesis is true than if the hypothesis is false. For the the example 
considered earlier, we have:
 %
 \[\frac{\Pr(\textit{no DNA match}|\textit{guilt})}{\Pr(\textit{no DNA match}|\neg \textit{guilt})} < 1.\]
%
Just as the two characterizations 
of evidential support are equivalent, so are the two characterizations of evidential attack, 
that is:
 %
\[ \Pr(H|E) < \Pr(H) \text{ iff} \frac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E|\neg H)} < 1.\]
%
The equivalence holds because the two hypotheses 
being compared in the likelihood ratio are 
the negation of each other.

\paragraph{The conflict between two pieces of evidence can be described probabilistically.}
Two pieces of evidence come into 
conflict with one another insofar as one supports a hypothesis 
and the other attacks the same hypothesis. 
The conflict can be described probabilistically, in that one piece of evidence increases 
the probability of the hypothesis, while the other decreases it, or equivalently, the likelihood ratio is positive (for one piece 
of evidence) and negative (for the other). 

For example, the testimony that the defendant was around the crime scene conflicts 
with the lack of a DNA match. Probabilistically, the testimony 
increases the probability of the defendant's guilt (or equivalently, the likelihood ratio is greater than one),
while the lack of a DNA match decreases the probability of the same hypothesis 
(or equivalently, the likelihood ratio is lower than one).

\section{Evidential value}
\label{sec:str}

The evidence found in a criminal investigation has different levels of evidential value: some evidence is  strong, other not so much. How is evidential value handled in each of the three normative frameworks? That is the topic of this section.

\subsection{Probability}

In the probabilistic framework, evidential value is quantified numerically using various 
concepts based 
on the probability calculus, that is, 
probabilistic difference, likelihood ratio and conditional probability on the evidence.
	
%\paragraph{The evidential value of a piece of evidence is measured by probabilistic difference or likelihood ratio (`incremental evidential value').}

\paragraph{The incremental evidential value is measured by probabilistic change.}
%BV Some reshaping is needed in this section, I'd say. 1. There is the evidential value of a piece of evidence; measured by probabilistic difference or LR (`incremental evidential value'). 2. There is the evidential value of all the evidence, in its totality; measured by the overall conditional prob (`total evidential value'). 3. DNA evidence is a good example, but there are complications.
%BV Below the discussion of the drunk witness is (for me) a complicated way of saying that a drunk witness has (by itself) hardly incremental evidential value. What is the lesson to be taught?
%BV In the part on DNA evidence I'd also reshape. For me the RMP connects a match (an actual match, M) probabilistically with the suspect being the source (S); we did that in the project paper verheijEtal2016. I'd first like to see that discussed, and then explained that there also are complications. Here the so-called hierarchy of propositions should be mentioned. cookEtAl1998, evettEtal2000 if I am correct.
The incremental value of evidence for, or against, a hypothesis 
can be quantified probabilistically in various ways. 
%The probabilistic framework allows us to quantify the strength of the evidential favoring or support relation between evidence and hypothesis. 
%The are different approaches in the literature. % (FITELSON REFERENCE HERE). 
%Let us begin with quantifying the value of the evidence \textit{for} an hypothesis. 
One approach considers the difference between the probability of 
the hypothesis with and without the evidence, that is, $\Pr(H | E) - \Pr(H)$.
%If $\Pr(H | E)$ is higher than $\Pr(H)$, this means that the evidence lends some support to
%the hypothesis. 
The larger the positive difference, the higher the value of the evidence 
for the hypothesis. 
%By contrast, the larger the negative difference, the higher the value of the evidence against the hypothesis. 
An alternative approach is given by the likelihood ratio $\Pr(E|H)/\Pr(E| \neg H)$. 
%For the evidence to offer some support to the hypothesis, the likelihood ratio should be at least greater than one. 
For any value greater than one, the higher the likelihood ratio, 
the higher the value of the evidence for the hypothesis. 
%For simplicity, we shall speak of evidential strength 
%in terms of likelihood ratios, as follows:
%
%\begin{quote}
%\textsc{Evidential strength:} The evidential strength of $E$ relative to $H$ is proportional to 
%the likelihood ratio $\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(H|\neg E)}$. 
%\end{quote}
%
%By contrast, for any value lower than one, the lower the likelihood ratio 
%the higher value of the evidence against the hypothesis. 
By contrast, a negative difference $\Pr(H | E) - \Pr(H)$ and a likelihood ratio lower than one 
quantify the value of the evidence \textit{against} a hypothesis.
The larger the negative difference and the lower the likelihood ratio (for any value below one), 
the higher the value of the evidence against the hypothesis.

Note that these two approaches parallel the two characterizations of evidential support and attack in the previous 
section, as probability increase/decrease and positive/negative likelihood ratio. While these notions were only qualitative, 
probability increases/decreases and likelihood ratios, as measures of evidential value, express quantities.

%As one can see from the table, there are quantitive 
%differences between the two approaches, but these should 
%not concern us here. Since the most widely used approach to quantify evidential value relies on 
%likelihood ratios, we shall use that, making occasional 
%references to the other approach if necessary. 

%\paragraph{The overall probability is not the same as probability difference and likelihood ratio}

%\paragraph{The evidential value of all the evidence, in its totality, is measured by the overall conditional probability (`overall evidential value'). }

\paragraph{The overall evidential value is measured by the overall conditional probability. }

In contrast with the incremental evidential value of evidence that is measured by a probabilistic difference or likelihood ratio, the overall evidential value of the full body of evidence is measured by the conditional probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. The higher, or lower, the probability $\Pr(H|E)$, the higher 
the overall value of the evidence for, or against, the hypothesis. If there are different pieces of evidence $E_1, \ldots, E_k$, 
the overall evidential value of the evidence is measured as $\Pr(H|E_1, \ldots, E_k)$.

Overall and incremental evidential value should not be confused. To illustrate, suppose we have strong evidence $E_1$ for the hypothesis $H$ 
that a suspect was at the crime scene, for instance, security camera footage in which the suspect is easily recognizable. 
In this case, the overall evidential value $\Pr(H|E_1)$ of the evidence is high. If this is the only evidence, then also the 
incremental evidential value is high: before the evidence is considered, the hypothesis is not strongly supported, i.e.\ $\Pr(H)$ is low, whereas after the evidence is considred, 
the hypothesis is strongly supported, i.e.\ $\Pr(H|E_1)$ is high. In this case, the overall and incremental evidential value of $E_1$ are both high. 
But suppose a witness testifies that the defendant was not at the crime scene (evidence $E_2$), but as it turns out, the witness is unreliable 
as a known accomplice of the suspect. Consider now the overall evidential value $\Pr(H|E_1, E_2)$ of the two pieces of evidence together. This will not have changed much when compared to $\Pr(H|E_1)$. As a result, the incremental evidential value of $E_2$ is low, while still the overall evidential value $\Pr(H|E_1, E_2)$ is high, even though $E_2$ did not contribute much. 

The difference between overall and incremental evidential value can be especially confusing when there is a single piece of evidence. % and there is a misalignment between the two values. 
Consider the hypothesis $\neg H$ that the suspect was not at the crime scene and the evidence $E_2$, the testimony of the unreliable witness. Now, 
if $\Pr(\neg H)$ is high, then $\Pr(\neg H | E_2)$ will be equally high because
$E_2$ has no incremental value. 
Uncritically interpreted, the high value of $\Pr(\neg H | E_2)$ suggests that the testimony of the unreliable witness has a high evidential value. But incrementally $E_2$ did not change much. The hypothesis $\neg H$ is, in totality, still strongly supported after the incrementally weak evidence $E_2$, since the hypothesis was already strongly supported before that evidence. 

%In this case, the incremental evidential value of the testimony in favor of guilt can be regarded as slightly incriminating. Hence we expect the probabilistic difference $\Pr(\textit{guilt} | \textit{drunk witness})$ to be a small positive value, and the likelihood ratio $\Pr(\textit{guilt} | \textit{drunk witness})/P(\textit{guilt} | \neg\textit{drunk witness})$ to be slightly above one.
%
%Now assume that the testimony by the drunk witness is the only incriminating evidence. In this case, 
%
%
%, the probability 
%$\Pr(\textit{guilt} | \textit{drunk witness})$ should also be low. Now, it follows that $\Pr(\textit{innocence} | \textit{drunk witness})$ 
%should be high insofar as \textit{innocence} is the negation of \textit{guilt}. 
%But this seems problematic. A drunk witness, in fact, is of little help in establishing 
%innocence (just as it is of little help in establishing guilt).
%
%It is instructive to quantify the value of the testimony in favor of guilt by means of 
%the probability difference and the likelihood ratio. Since the witness was drunk, the value of the evidence in favor of guilt is 
%low, that is:
%%
%\[\text{the positive difference $\Pr(\textit{guilt} | \textit{drunk witness}) - P(\textit{guilt})$ is small, and}\]
%%
%%
%\[\text{the likelihood ratio $\frac{\Pr(\textit{guilt} | \textit{drunk witness})}{\Pr(\textit{guilt} | \neg\textit{drunk witness})}$ is only slightly above one}.\] 
%%
%Similarly, the value of the evidence in favor of innocence is also low, that is:
%%
%\[\text{the negative difference $\Pr(\textit{innocence} | \textit{drunk witness}) - P(\textit{guilt})$ is small, and}\]
%%
%%
%\[\text{the likelihood ratio $\frac{\Pr(\textit{innocence} | \textit{drunk witness})}{\Pr(\textit{innocence} | \neg\textit{drunk witness})}$ is only slightly below one}.\] 
%%
%So, the value of the testimony in favor of guilt, and innocence, is low 
%in both cases. This means that $\Pr(\textit{guilt} | \textit{drunk witness})$
%and $\Pr(\textit{guilt})$ are roughly the same value, and so are $\Pr(\textit{innocence} | \textit{drunk witness})$ 
%and $\Pr(\textit{innocence})$. Consequently, if $\Pr(\textit{innocence})$ is high, 
%and thus $\Pr(\textit{guilt})$ low, $\Pr(\textit{innocence} | \textit{drunk witness})$ will 
%be high, and thus $\Pr(\textit{guilt} | \textit{drunk witness})$ low. %, given the little evidential value of the testimony. 
%We should thus not be surprised that $\Pr(\textit{innocence} | \textit{drunk witness})$ is high. 
%This is because, by Bayes' theorem, $\Pr(H|E)$ depends on $\Pr(H)$. 
%Even if $E$ does not change significantly the probability of $H$, or the likelihood ratio (positive or negative) 
%$\frac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E| \neg H)}$ is small, $\Pr(H|E)$ could still be high or low, insofar as $\Pr(H)$ itself is high or low. 
%All in all, we should be careful in not confusing a high probability $\Pr(H|E)$ with a high 
%evidential value in terms of a large probability difference or a high likelihood ratio.


\paragraph{The use of evidence with high incremental evidential value has complications.}

%A widely used measure of evidential value 
%is the likelihood ratio. 
As an illustration, we discuss the likelihood ratio 
of a DNA match. %, where the match is between
%the crime scene's genetic profile and the defendant's. 
%Suppose the DNA test reports a match between the crime traces and the defendant. %Given our simplifying assumptions, 
When introduced in court, a DNA match comes with a so-called 
Random Match Probability or, as of late, with its Conditional Genotype Probability.
This (roughly) is the probability that the DNA of a random person, who 
had nothing to do with the crime, would match. 
Let us denote this probability by $\gamma$. %An RMP is derived from the estimated frequency of the DNA profile across a sample population. 
%We should bear in mind that genetic profiles are not unique. 
%Based on statistical and genetic modeling, a profile is expected to occur 
%with a certainfrequency in a select population. 
%

With some simplifications (on these later), 
the evidential value of the DNA 
match $M$ in favor of the hypothesis that the 
suspect is the source of the crime traces, abbreviated $S$, % in terms of a likelihood ratio, 
is as follows %~\citep{Dawid02, Balding2005Weight}:
%
\[
\frac{\Pr(M | S)}{\Pr(M | \neg S)} =  \frac{1}{\gamma}.
\]
%
%BV RMP is as yet undefined
The numerator $\Pr(M | S)$ equals 1 because we assume that %of our simplifying assumption that 'source' and guilt' are interchangeable 
%and the laboratory test is infallible. If 
if the defendant is the source of the crime traces%and thus the source of the crime traces
, the laboratory test will report a match. As for the denominator, 
%keep in mind that $RMP$ is the probability that a random person, 
%unrelated to the crime or the defendant, would be found to have a matching DNA. 
assuming $\Pr(M | \neg S)=\gamma$ is plausible because the probability that a match would be reported if the defendant was \textit{not} 
the source is roughly the same as the chance that someone who had no contact with the victim would randomly match. 
%and because (2) 'source' and 'guilt' are, by assumption, equivalent.
For example, if $\gamma$ is 1 in 200 million, the likelihood ratio would be
%
\[\frac{\Pr(M |S)}{\Pr( M | \neg S)}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\text{200 million}}}=\text{200 million}.\]
%
Since the likelihood ratio in question is a high number, the DNA match has strong evidential value in favor of the hypothesis that the suspect is the source. 
More generally, a low random match or genotype probability $\gamma$ corresponds to a match with a rare profile, and thus has a high evidential value. 

Still, even with a low $\gamma$ one should beware of the complications when using a DNA match in a criminal case. %to establish the guilt of a suspect. 
Consider the following, non-equivalent hypotheses: %which are progressively more removed from guilt: 

\begin{enumerate}

	\item 
The \textit{lab reports} that the defendant's 
genetic profile matches with the crime traces;

	\item 
The defendant's genetic profile \textit{truly matches} with the crime traces; 

	\item 
The defendant is the \textit{source} of the traces; 

%the defendant \textit{left} the crime traces; 

	\item 
The defendant \textit{visited} the crime scene;  and

%the defendant \textit{participated} in the crime; 

	\item 
The defendant is \textit{factually guilty}.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The inferential path from `reported match' 
to `guilt', passing through the intermediate steps `true match', `source' and `visit', is a long one, 
and each step comes with sources of error that may undermine the inference along the way. 

First, the inference from `reported match' to `true match' depends on whether or not 
the laboratory made a mistake. A key source of laboratory mistakes are human errors, much more frequent than DNA profiles.
%A more sophisticated probabilistic analysis will show that a RMP as low as 1/1 billion----which in our simplistic analysis would give rise to a likelihood ratio as high as 1 billion--- reduces to about 100 likelihood ratio if the laboratory error rate is 1\%.
Second, the inference from `true match' to `source' can go wrong in several ways. For one, 
someone who is entirely unrelated with the crime could 
be, by sheer coincidence, a true match. This could happen, although the chance of this happening remains typically low as 
measured by the Random Match Probability or Conditional Genotype Probability. For another, a suspect who is not 
the source of the crime traces could still match because of close family relations with the actual perpetrator. 
Think of a perpetrator who has a genetically identical twin. %A suspect's genetically identical twin has identical DNA. %, and twins are much less rare than good DNA profiles. 
%There is also the possibility that synthetic genetic material, perfectly matching one's DNA, was planted. 
%In this background, the second simplifying assumption we made was that the inference from `true match' to `source' can be undermined by one source of error only, namely the possibility that another random individual could coincidentally match. This possibility of error is captured by the Random Match Probability. 
%If RMP equal 1 in 200, we would expected 1 such profile every two hundred people or the RMP equals 0.5\%. Other sources of error, for example, a twin brother or an artificially synthesized matching DNA, were disregard. 
Third, the inference from `source' to `visiting the crime scene' is not infallible. In particular, the traces can have been accidentally transferred to the crime scene or have been planted there. Fourth, the inference from `visiting the crime scene' to `factual guilt' can go wrong in many ways, because having visited a crime scene is not the same as having committed the crime.

%From a probabilistic point of view, laboratory errors can be quantified if the lab error rates are available, 
%but other sources of error are more difficult to quantify. How often does it happen that 
%synthesized matching DNA is implanted? Or what is the probability of error 
%in the inference from `source' to `guilt'?
%The moral is that, in weighting the value of DNA match with a high likelihood ratio, 
%one should always be wary of the sources of error that were, and were not, taken into account in the calculations. 
%All in all, even if the RMP is very low, this does not mean 
%that the evidential value of the DNA match in favor of guilt will be very high.

\subsection{Arguments}
\label{sec:valueArgs}

The evidential value of arguments can be analyzed in terms of the strength 
of the reasons they are built from, but also by asking critical questions 
about the reasons of the argument, its conclusion and the connection 
between reasons and conclusion. 

\paragraph{The reasons used can be conclusive or 
defeasible.} A reason is conclusive when, given the reason, its conclusion is guaranteed. The main type of conclusive reason corresponds to 
deductive, logically valid reasoning. 
%BV adapted [WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT A REASON CORRESPONDS TO AN ARGUMENT?] 
An example of a conclusive reason occurs in the logically valid argument from the reasons `John is shot' and `If someone is shot, he dies', to 
the conclusion `John dies'. 
%`The witness saw the suspect commit the crime and the suspect denies having been at the crime scene' to the conclusion `The suspect denies having been at the crime scene'. 
Its logical validity is connected to the underlying logical structure of the argument: 
%From A AND B, conclude B. 
from `A' and `A implies B', conclude `B'. 
% BV I don't think so. :-) [IT IS ODD TO READ 'REASON' WHILE WHAT IT MEANS IS 'PREMISE'. SEEMS STANDARD TO TALK ABOUT PREMISES AND CONCLUSIONS, WHILE YOU SEEM TO PREFER CONCLUSIONS AND REASONS. IS THERE SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THIS? MAYBE SAY SOMEWHERE WE WIL USE 'REASON' TO MEAN 'PREMISE'?] 

Many reasons are not conclusive, but defeasible. There are circumstances in which the conclusion does not follow, although the reason obtains. The reason `The witness reports to have seen the suspect at the crime scene' supports the conclusion `The suspect was at the crime scene', but does not guarantee that conclusion, because 
the witness could have made a mistake. A defeasible reason can provide \textit{prima facie} justification for a conclusion, which might later 
be withdrawn in light of countervailing reasons.
%
% BV I don't think so. :-) [IT IS STRANGE TO READ THAT A REASON IS DEFEASIBLE OR CONCLUSIVE. AN ARGUMENT IS, NOT THE REASON ITSELF. IT DEPENDS WHAT IT IS A REAOSN OF. CONFUSED ABOUT THIS.]
%
%BV Removed this bit since not needed:
%Conclusive and defeasible reasons correspond to one-step conclusive and defeasible arguments. [AGAIN, UNCLEAR TO ME IN WHAT SENSE A REASONS CORRESPONDS TO AN ARGUMENT. I THOUGHT REASON CORRESPONDED TO PREMISE.] 
%Some other terms are used in connection with the difference between conclusive and defeasible arguments. For instance, there is the triplet of deductive, abductive, and inductive arguments. Consider the rule `If someone is shot, he dies'. A deductive argument involving this rule applies the rule to an instance of its antecedent: From `John is shot' and `If someone is shot, he dies', conclude `John dies'. 
%
Reasons that occur in so-called \textit{abductive arguments} are also defeasible, where 
abductive arguments can be thought of as providing an explanation. %, %. Abductive arguments 
%An abductive argument using this rule uses an instance of the rule's consequent as a starting point, to infer the antecedent: 
For example, from `John's DNA matches the crime trace' conclude `John left the trace'.
%and `If someone is shot, he dies', conclude `John is shot'. 
%The fact that John was shot is put forward as an explanation for Johns's death. 
The fact that John left the trace is put forward as an explanation for the fact that John's DNA matches the trace. 
Abductive arguments are typically defeasible because there often are alternative explanations. %John's death might have been caused by natural causes. 
Someone with the same genetic profile as John might have left the trace. 

%Inductive arguments generalize from an instance of the rule's antecedent and consequent (or several such instances) to the rule: From `John is shot' and `John dies', conclude: `If someone is shot, he dies'. Inductive arguments are also typically defeasible, as the inferred rule often does not hold, at least not in full generality. Deductive arguments are also contrasted with ampliative arguments. In that distinction, deductive arguments only lead to conclusions that were already implicit in their premises, whereas ampliative arguments go beyond their premises. Arguing from A AND B to B is deductive in this sense, and from A to B ampliative.

%MDB [NOT SURE WE NEED ALL THIS TERMINOLOGY. COMPLICATED. REALLY NEEDED?]


\paragraph{Arguments can be evaluated by asking critical questions} % and the evaluation of the argument depends on the answers given.} 
%Defeasible reasons are characterized by the possibility of circumstances that have the effect that the conclusion of the reason does not follow, given the reason. [YOU TALK ABOUT CONCLUSION OF THE REASON. LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE USING 'REASON' AS THE SAME AS 'ARGUMENT'. ISN'T THIS STRANGE?]The occurrence of such defeating circumstances can be guided by asking critical questions. 
%The answers to those critical questions provide insight into the evidential value of the reasons. 
Consider again the one-step argument from the reason `The witness reports that she saw the suspect at the crime scene' to the conclusion `The suspect was at the crime scene'. 
%[NOW YOU USE 'REASON' AS THE SAME AS 'PREMISE'.] 
Critical questions can be asked about the argument. They include, for example, whether there are reasons to doubt the suspect was at the crime scene, such as an alibi; whether there 
are reasons to doubt that the witness testimony supports the conclusion that the suspect was at the crime scene, for instance, the witness is lying; and whether there are 
reasons to doubt the existence of the witness testimony, such as a fraudulent report. The first of these questions is directed at the argument's conclusion, the second at the argument step from reason to conclusion, and the third at the argument's reason. These different kinds of critical questions are connected to the three kinds of argument attack discussed in Section~\ref{sec:confArg} (see in particular Figure~\ref{fig:arg3}, page~\pageref{fig:arg3}). 

But what do critical questions do? How do they help us assess the strength of arguments?
Suppose that initially it is believed that the suspect was at the crime scene because of the witness testimony. A positive answer to any of the critical questions mentioned 
above will weaken the support for the conclusion that the suspect was at the crime scene, perhaps up to the point of making it no longer believable.

\paragraph{It can be subject to debate whether a reason supports or attacks a conclusion.} 
Whether a reason supports a conclusion depends on an underlying general rule. For instance, the argument from a witness testimony (the reason) to the suspect's being at the crime scene (the conclusion) rests on the general rule that what witnesses say can generally be believed. Following~\citet{toulmin1958}'s terminology, such general rules making explicit how to get from the reason to the conclusion are referred to as \textit{warrants}. Support for a warrant is called the backing of the warrant.

More generally,  a reason can either support or attack a conclusion, so the relation between reason and conclusion can be a supporting relation 
or an attacking relation. These supporting or attacking relations can, in turn, be themselves supported or attacked. This gives rise to four different combinations: support of a supporting relation; support of an attacking relation; attack of a supporting relation; and attack of an attacking relation. In Figure~\ref{fig:nesting}, these situations are illustrated by two opposite witness testimonies.

\paragraph{Args win when they can defend themselves against attacks (Dung 1995)}

Dung REFERENCE provided an abstract framework to analyze 
systems of arguments. The notion of an argument attacking another argument 
is taken as primitive. We can think of systems of argument as an alliance of arguments, and in particular, 
following Dung's framework, the system $S$ of arguments is a \textit{successful alliance} provided:
%
\begin{quote}
(\textit{conflict-free}) each argument in $S$ is not attacked by any argument in $S$; and 

(\textit{defense}) for any argument (outside $S$) that attacks any argument in $S$, there is an argument inside $S$ that attacks the attacker.
\end{quote}
%
So, a system of arguments forms a successful alliance provided there is no internal conflict and any external attack 
can be counterattacked by arguments within the alliance. The notions of a winning and losing argument can now be defined:
%
\begin{quote}
(\textit{winning}) $A$ \textit{wins} provided $A$ is part of a successful alliance; and 

(\textit{losing} ) $A$ \textit{loses} provided another argument $A'$ attacks $A$ and $A'$ wins. 
\end{quote}
%
These definitions are intuitive. If an argument can defend itself from any attack by appealing to its allies, it wins. If, instead, there is a winning argument that attacks an argument, the latter loses. A problem here, however, is that an argument can be both winning and losing. 
Consider four arguments $A, B$ and $A', B'$ such that $A'$ attacks $A$ and vice versa, and $B$ attacks $B'$ and vice versa. The system $\{A, B\}$ is a successful alliance because there are no internal conflicts and any attack against $A$ or $B$ is counterattacked within the alliance $\{A, B\}$. It follows that arguments $A$ and $B$ both win. At the same time, the system $\{ A', B'\}$ is also 
a successful alliance, so arguments $A'$ and $B'$ win. This means that $A$ and $B$ both lose because each is attacked by a winning argument, and the same holds for $A'$ and $B'$.

%(Intuitively, alliance $\{A, B\}$ and $\{A', B'\}$ are symmetrical in the sense that any argument in one alliance is attacked but an argument in the other alliance. No one appears to be stronger then the other. If, however, we compared $\{A, B, C\}$ and $\{A', B'\}$ and added the condition that $C$ attacks either $A'$ or $B'$ and $\{A, B, C\}$ had no internal conflicts, it would follow that $\{A', B'\}$ is not a successful alliance anymore and thus the only winning arguments would be $A$ and $B$. One easy fix could be to require that successful alliances cannot be symmetrical to other successful alliance. This means for any give set of arguments there is only one successful alliances.)

(As far as evidential reasoning in the law is concerned, something is unsettling about this state of affairs. There is something unnatural about the systems $\{A, B\}$ and $\{A', B'\}$ and the fact that $A$ attack $A'$ and vice versa, and the same holds for $B$ and $B'$.
Suppose an eyewitness asserts she saw the defendant stab the victim and another witness asserts the eyewitness is biased because she has reasons to hate the defendant. The second witness attacks the testimony of the eyewitness. This exemplifies an attack against $A$ by $A'$. There is nothing problematic about that. But now suppose the eyewitness defended herself against the second witness by asserting that the second witness is biased against her because the witness has reasons to hate her. This exemplifies a situation in which $A$ attacks $A'$. There is nothing problematic about that either. But, although the fact that $A$ attacks $A'$ and vice versa are fine as isolated attacks, when they are considered together, they become problematic. Suppose we engage in a conversation in which I assert conclusion $C$ on the basis of evidence $e$ and you challenge me by challenging $e$ on the basis of other evidence $e'$. Next, I defend myself by challenging your evidence $e'$ and I do so by using my evidence $e$. You challenge targets $e$ on the basis of $e'$ and I target $e'$ on the basis of $e$. This is a stale mate and a circle of attack and counterattack. Ideally, we would need further evidence, besides $e$ and $e'$, to resolve the controversy. In the court example, a third witness is needed who can tell us whether the first eyewitness or the second witness is biased. So, an easy fix to the above problem, especially when it comes to evidential reasoning in the law, is to require that stalemate situations or circles of attacks and counterattacks be avoided.)

\paragraph{Args win when they are better/stronger than/preferred over conflicting args}

Dung's framework considers system of arguments and the relations of attack and counterattack among arguments, but does not examine the internal structure of arguments. The notions of attack and counterattack are left unspecified, and the notion of a successful 
attack is also left unspecified. To be sure, all we can say from Dung's framework is that an attack is successful when 
it consists of a winning argument. We are told nothing more about the internal structure of arguments.

 Prakken REFERENCE has provided a unified theory of argumentation which builds on Dung's insights but also examines 
 the internal structure of arguments. As seen earlier, argument can be attacked in three ways. An argument can be attacked by offering another argument with the opposite conclusion (rebutting). An argument can be attacked by offering an argument that weakens the inferential link between premises and conclusion (undercutting). An argument can be attacked by challenging its premises (undermining). The remaining question is, when is an attack successful? 

Let us begin with an example of one argument rebutting another. A witness asserts that the defendant stabbed the victim, while DNA evidence shows no match between the defendant and the crime traces. The argument based on an witness statements is rebutted by---but also rebuts---the argument based on the DNA match. The attack works in both direction in the sense that bother arguments attack one another regardless of which argument is made first. Is the attack successful? In Dung's framework, the answer is that both arguments win and both arguments lose (provided both arguments are part of a successful alliance). This is hardly satisfying. 

A step forward is a ranking among arguments. A rebutting argument $A'$ is considered a successful attack on an argument $A$ whenver $A$ is ranked higher than $A'$. How can arguments be ranked? The ranking will depend on the relative strength we assign to the premises and to the inferential link between premises and conclusion. Consider an abstract example. The first argument consists of premises $A$ and the defeasible inference $A\Rightarrow B$, while the second argument consists of premises $A'$ and the defeasible inference $A'\Rightarrow \neg B$. The conclusion of the first argument is $B$ and the conclusion of the second argument is the negation of $B$. Which argument ranks higher? This will depend on whether we consider $A$ a better premise---for example, more probable---than $A'$. It will also depend on whether we consider $A\Rightarrow B$ a better inference---for example, more likely to preserve the truth---than $A'\Rightarrow \neg B$. Clearly, other things being equal, if $A$ is better than $A'$, the first argument is ranked higher. However, if $A$ is a better premise but $A'\Rightarrow \neg B$ is a better inference, it is not easy to adjudicate the ranking of the two arguments.

Consider now a case in which an argument undercuts another argument. There is nothing peculiar about this case. We can apply the same ideas as in the rebutting case. In order for the attack to be successful, the undercutting argument must be ranked higher than the attacked argument. 
If not, the attack launched by the undercutting argument must fail. 
 
Finally, the third type of attack: undermining. An attack against a premise can consists in a one line statement that the premise is false or can be a more elaborate argument resulting in the denial of the premise. How can we tell which attacks on the premises are successful? At first blush, one mighty say that the mere statement that the premise is false would not do, but this would be too simplistic. Premises come in different guises and sometimes it might be enough to merely disagree with a premise and some other times a more sustained argument might be necessary. To illustrate, consider three types of premises. REFERENCES TO PRAKKEN AND GORDON

First, premises can be axioms or self evident statements. If the premises are axioms or self evident, they cannot be attacked. An attack against an axiom or a self evident premise will therefore always fail. 

Second, premises can also be assumptions or statements that are taken for granted without explicitly supporting reasons. Assumptions are peculiar in that that they hold until contrary evidence shows they are false. Assumptions are close to what in the law are known as presumptions. Suppose the prosecutor argues that a mail package containing drugs was received by the defendant. The prosecutor has proof that the package was mailed and that it reached the defendant's address. The prosecutor has no explicitly proof that the packed was delivered to the defendant. The prosecutor \textit{assumes} that if the package was sent and received at the defendant's address, it was the defendant who received it. What if the defendant challenges the assumption alleging that he was not at home when the package was delivered? This raises the question of who has the burden of proof. Should the prosecutor give evidence that the assumption is correct or should the defendant give evidence that the assumption is incorrect, and in absence of contrary evidence, should the assumption be taken to be correct? 
If we are in fact dealing with an assumption, it is up to the party who challenges the assumption to show that it is correct. Assumptions are true until contrary evidence is provided. 

Finally, we have ordinary premises. These must be defended with adequate evidence and arguments and cannot be assumed the be true. If the a party attacks an argument by challenging an ordinary premise, the burden of proof is on the party proposing the argument to back up the premise. Ordinary premises, in this sense, are different from assumptions. In short, axioms or self evident premises cannot be challenged. Assumptions are assumed to hold until contrary evidence is presented. The burden of proof is on the attacking party. Ordinary premises can only be believed on the basis of supporting evidence or arguments. The burden of prof here is on the attacked party. 

An attack against the premises of an argument will succeed or fail depending on the targeted premises. Attacks against self evident premises always fail. Attacks against assumptions are successful only if evidence is introduced that the assumption is indeed false. Attacks against ordinary premises succeeds even though no evidence that the premise is false is introduced and provided that the other party has introduced no evidence for the truth of the premise. If the other party has introduced evidence for the truth of the premise, the premise is the conclusion of an argument, and thus the attack must take form of a rebuttal.

\subsection{Scenarios}

The evidential value of a scenario depends on how well it matches up with the evidence. 
This matching up can be understood in three ways: the scenario's plausibility and logical consistency; its power to explain the evidence; 
its consistency with the evidence. We examine each in turn. 
%a scenario's consistency 
%with the evidence; its power to explain the evidence; 
%and its evidential support. 
%We consider consider each in turn.


\paragraph{Scenarios can be plausible and logically consistent.}

Plausibility measures how well a scenario matches up with 
our background assumptions and knowledge of the world. %The events that constitute a scenario must be linked by relations of temporal order and causality. 
At least, a scenario should not violate the laws of nature or common sense. If a scenario asserts that the same individual was in two different locations 
at the same time, or moved from one location to another in too short amount of time, the scenario would lack plausibility. 
The scenario `an alien did it' lacks plausibility because it describes something that rarely happens. 
Lack of plausibility can become so pronounced that it amounts to a lack of \textit{logical consistency}, for example, claiming that 
 the defendant had and did \textit{not} have a motive for killing the victim.
 
Recall now the two conflicting scenarios we considered earlier:
%
\begin{description}
	\item $S_1$: The defendant killed the victim when caught during a robbery.
	\item $S_2$: The victim's partner killed the victim after a violent fight between the two.
	%\item $S_2$: The defendant was at home with his wife.	
\end{description}
%
Which one is the most plausible?
Statistics suggest that people 
are less often killed by strangers than by people they know. 
If so, scenario $S_2$ would be initially more plausible. However, suppose we acquired more background information about 
the relationship between the victim and her partner, and it turned out their relationship was peaceful. In light of this new information, 
scenario $S_2$ will appear less plausible than $S_1$. It does not happen often that anger and violence manifest 
themselves unannounced, while it is natural that a robber, once he is discovered and has no alternative, will resort to violence. 

In assessing plausibility, the evidence with which the scenario is expected to match 
 up is not the evidence specific to the case, but rather, background information about the world. 
Plausibility has something to do with what we might can \textit{normality}, that is, with
what happens most of the time. % A scenario according to which the defendant covered 500 mile of distance by car is more plausible than a scenario in which the
%defendant covered the same distance by foot. The former happens more often than the latter. 
 It is true, however, that criminal cases are often about odd coincidences, 
unexpected and improbable events. Plausibility only measures the persuasiveness or credibility 
of a scenario \textit{prior to} considering any more specific evidence about the crime. An initially plausible scenario may turn 
out to be weakly supported in light of more evidence presented about the crime. 

 
%But the former need not be more plausible than the latter. 
%Consistency with the laws of nature and common sense, whether the parts 
%of the scenario ``hang together'' nicely (cohesiveness and internal consistency) 
%are also indicators of plausibility. 


%The plausibility of a scenario is weakened when the components of the scenario, its
%sub-scenarios, cannot be easily combined together. This could also be understood as 
%a lack of \textit{cohesiveness} among the components of a scenario. So, not only the scenario should explain the evidence, but certain
% components of a scenario should explain others. Typically we expect that events prior in time 
% explain events later in time. 
 
 

%The terminology used here---plausibility, logical consistency, cohesiveness, normality---can be confusing. 
%Still, the main idea is that a scenario can be evaluated against what a reasonable person thinks 
%it would happen given a set of circumstances. 

\paragraph{The more evidence a scenario can explain, the better.}

When a case comprises several items of evidence, 
%the interpretation of the evidence becomes holistic. 
%a scenarios's credibility depends on how it can account for the whole mass of evidence. 
 the more items of evidence a scenario can accommodate, preferably from both the prosecutor and the defense, 
 the better the scenario. This depends on the scenario's explanatory power and consistency with the evidence. 
 % These criteria were already discussed earlier. 
 %The difference now is that consistency, explanatory power and evidential support should 
 %be measured relative to the totality of the evidence. 
 
 Consider a case in which two items of evidence must be explained. The first 
 is the presence of fingerprint traces at the crime scene, traces whose 
 presence is consistent with just innocent contact. The second is that the fingerprints match with the defendant. 
Scenarios $S_1$ and $S_2$---the robber scenario and the victim's 
partner scenario, respectively---both explain the presence of fingerprint traces at the crime. They were left either by 
the robber, if $S_1$ is true, or by the victim's partner, if $S_2$ is true. Still, 
only $S_1$ can explain the fact that the traces match with the defendant 
(who is the alleged robber). 
 % Recall the two scenarios from the previous section, namely,
%
%\begin{description}
%	\item $S_1$: The defendant killed the victim when caught during a robbery.
%	\item $S_2$: The victim's partner killed the victim after a violent fight between the two.
	%\item $S_2$: The defendant was at home with his wife.	
%\end{description}
%
%Suppose scenario $S_1$ comprises the event that the 
%defendant visited the crime scene, while $S_2$ compromises the event that some other individual visited the crime scene. 

But suppose that in order to defend $S_2$---the victim's 
partner scenario---a new detail is added to the story: the victim's partner, right after killing the victim and with the intent to mislead the investigators, 
implanted fingerprint traces that match the defendant. This new scenario, however implausible, can 
explain both items of evidence: the presence of the fingerprint 
and the fact that they match the defendant's. As far as explanatory power goes, 
scenarios $S_1$ and $S_2$, when properly supplemented, are now on a par with one another. Still, further evidence may distinguish the two. 
For example, if a witness testified she saw the defendant/robber walk towards the location of the crime immediately before the crime was committed, 
scenario $S_2$ cannot easily explain the testimony, even when supplemented with additional information. By contrast, 
$S_1$ can easily explain the testimony. Absent other evidence, scenario $S_1$ explains 
more evidence than the competing scenario $S_2$, in both its original and updated version. 
 

\paragraph{The more pieces of evidence a scenario is consistent with, the better.}

Besides plausibility and explanatory power, we can evaluate a scenario by checking whether it is 
consistent with the evidence presented in a case. 
The more pieces of evidence the scenario 
is consisted with, the better.

We can define consistency as lack of inconsistency between the evidence (taken at face value) and the scenario. 
For example, if a witness testifies that the defendant was at home with his girlfriend 
at 6 PM, while according to the scenario proposed by the prosecutor, 
the defendant was at the crime scene at 6 PM, the 
two are inconsistent. Here we are dealing we what we earlier called quasi-inconsistency, in the sense that
insofar as the evidence is taken at face value---that is, the witness is taken to be truthful---the scenario 
is inconsistent with the evidence. An inconsistency in this sense between the evidence and a proposed scenario need 
not be damning for the scenario. It might, in fact, turn out that the witness was untruthful or simply confused about 
the timing. If so, the evidence will be discarded, not the scenario. 

But, if a scenario is inconsistent with several pieces of evidence, this becomes an increasingly powerful challenge against the scenario. 
For example, if the timing provided by the scenario is not only inconsistent 
with the first witness testimony but also with the testimony of a pizza delivery man, 
who claims to have delivered a pizza to the house of the defendant's girlfriend, around 6PM, and remembers having received money 
from the defendant, then the prosecutor's scenario is further undermined. In short, the more pieces of evidence 
inconsistent with the scenario, the more powerful the challenges against the scenario.
This conclusion can also be stated more positively. The more pieces of evidence consistent with the scenario, 
the higher the evidential value of the scenario.



%Suppose a video recording shows the defendant went into a bank 
%and committed a robbery, and instead, the scenario proposed by the defense denies precisely that. The defense 
%will be hard pressed to justify the proposed scenario given the inconsistency 
%with the evidence.

\section{Coherently interpreting the evidence}
\label{sec:cohint}

The dossiers of criminal cases can be large, and the coherent interpretation of the evidence in such a dossier can 
be daunting, whichever normative framework is used. For each framework, we discuss how the coherent 
interpretation of the evidence can be addressed.

\subsection{Scenarios}

%In the previous section, we evaluated scenarios by how well they matched up with the evidence, in terms of consistency, explanatory power and evidential support.
%These were atomistic criteria. 

Scenarios can provide coherent interpretations that make sense of the evidence.
We examine three dimensions along which competing scenarios, considered holistically in their entirety, 
can be assessed: coherence; completeness; and explanatory power.  
%These three dimensions also describe how different pieces of evidence can be combined. 

 
\paragraph{Scenarios are coherent clusters 
of events, ordered in time and with causal relations.} 
Earlier we encountered an elementary murder case scenario, namely, 
a robber kills the victim when caught during a robbery ($S_1$). This scenario 
can be analyzed as having a specific 
temporal structure:
%Scenario $S_2$ can be analyzed as consisting of three events. 
first, the robber enters the victim's house ($H_1$); then, the victim accidentally encounters the robber ($H_2$); and finally, 
the robber kills the victim ($H_3$). 

Some of the events in this temporally 
ordered scenario are also causally connected. %in the first scenario, the killing is caused by the break up and the fight; and in the second scenario by 
The accidental encounter is the cause that triggers a reaction 
in the robber who then kills the victim. 
Causal relations among the different parts, or episodes, 
in a scenario are important to evaluate what we might 
call the \textit{coherence} of a scenario. 

Contrast the robbery scenario $S_1$
with the partner scenario $S_2$ we countered earlier.
%If this scenario holds, the victim's partner was the killer, not the robber. 
Suppose this scenario is articulated more in detail as follows: 
the victim and her partner were watching a show on TV and eating Chinese take-out, 
when the partner killed the victim. 
This scenario has a clear temporal structure: the victim's partner arrives at the victim's home ($H_4$); then, 
they watch TV while eating Chinese take-out ($H_5$); finally, the victim's partner kills the victim ($H_6$). 
Still, something is missing here, that is, the causal link between `watching TV' and `killing'. Why would peacefully 
watching TV suddenly turn into fatal violence?
In comparison, the first scenario scores better in terms 
of causal structure. The first scenario 
is more coherent than the second. 

%See figure \ref{fig:scens}.

%Consider again a murder example with two suspects: the victim's former partner, who killed the victim after a fight ($S_1$), and . Scenario $S_1$ can be made explicit as a sequence of four hypothetical consecutive events (Figure~\ref{fig:scens}). First, the victim and his former partner have a relation ($H_1$); then they break up ($H_2$); subsequently, there is a fight ($H_3$); and finally, the victim is killed by his former partner ($H_4$). 
\begin{figure}[bt]
\centering
\input{img/scenarios2}
\caption{Scenarios and their structure\label{fig:scens}. 
The second scenario lacks in causal structure.}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Scenarios can be more or less complete.}

Another criterion to evaluate scenarios is their \textit{completeness}. Since scenarios are discursive arrangements of events, ordered according to 
temporal and causal relations, they may contain gaps in time, space and causality. A scenario may not describe the defendant's whereabouts between 4 and 6 PM, 
while it describes, rather precisely, what the defendant did at 7 PM, immediately before the killing took place. The temporal gap between 4 and 6 PM 
makes it less complete than a scenario which describes the defendant's whereabouts between 4 and 7 PM without gaps. 
Yet, this might not be the notion of completeness that is important here to evaluate scenarios. 

%Completeness depends on factors such as relevance, causal structure and expectations. 
%In a murder case, the identity of the perpetrator, the motive, the 
%modus operandi of the crime and the weapon are relevant elements which a scenario should specify. 
%The lack of any of these from a proposed scenario would make it incomplete. 
%The law itself sometimes requires that specific elements be proven, 
%for example, in criminal cases both the \textit{mens rea} and \textit{actus reus} 
%must be proven.  Still,

The law is not very specific in this respect. 
%does not say whether the defendant's whereabouts the day before or a month before 
%the murder are relevant. 
Besides defining the crime and requiring that both \textit{mens rea}---the
 intention to do harm---and \textit{actus reus}---the occurrence of the physical harm---be established, the law does 
 not say how detailed the prosecutor's reconstruction of the crime should be. 
So, how is completeness a criterion to evaluate a scenario? 

Some suggest that scenarios must follow certain patterns, 
schematic structures or scripts. For example, in most violent crimes, we can identify an initial 
moment of conflict. This triggers a psychological reaction that gives rise to the formation of an 
intention, which, in turn, later results in the violent act. On this account, a scenario is 
complete whenever it has \textit{all of its parts}, at least given an appropriate 
scenario script or schematic structure. Scenario $S_2$, in this sense, is incomplete 
because it does say why and how the victim's partner formed 
the intention to kill the victim nor does it describe any initial moment of conflict. 
Scenario $S_1$ does not say, exactly, why the robber killed the victim. But the reason can be easily inferred. Presumably, 
the robber formed the intention to kill the victim when he was caught by surprise and saw no better alternative. 



%The notion of completeness, then, overlaps with that of plausibility and cohesiveness of a scenario.
%All in all, evaluating a scenario required different levels of analysis: consistency with the evidence; 
%explanatory power (predictive power and causal fit); evidential support; plausibility (and also, cohesiveness, internal consistency and normality); completeness.




\paragraph{Weaker scenarios can be better supported by the evidence.} 

The coherence and completeness of a scenario play a role in its evaluation. However, a weaker scenario in terms of coherence and completeness may be the best explanation of the evidence. Earlier we saw that the robbery scenario was more coherent than the scenario in which the victim's friend kills the victim while eating Chinese take-out in front of the TV. But now suppose that the pieces of evidence are as follows: the investigators find Chinese take-out in the victim's house ($E_1$); the saliva on one fork matches with the victim's friend DNA ($E_2$); there are no signs of forced entry into the victim's house ($E_3$). While the robbery scenario was more coherent, the Chinese take-out scenario explains the three items of evidence. In fact, the robbery scenario cannot explain any of them. So, a scenario might be superior to another on one dimension, for example, the robbery scenario is more coherent than the Chinese take-out scenario, but inferior on another dimension, for example, the robbery scenario has less explanatory power than the Chinese take-out scenario. 






%A criminal case is only solved when the legally relevant circumstances can be proven. For instance, in murder cases, it should be proven who killed the victim and why. Of the scenarios considered, the former partner murder scenario $S_1$ and the robbery murder scenario $S_2$ explain how and why the murder happened, but the alibi scenario $S_3$ does not. In a crime investigation, it can be hard to find evidence that proves a sufficiently detailed scenario about what has happened. For instance, in the example, it is initially clear that a murder had happened, but not by who. Because of the break up, a scenario that answers the why-question is considered: the former partner murder scenario $S_1$. That scenario is initially corroborated by the DNA match $E_1$, but then breaks down by the use of the bank card $E_2$ that proves the alibi scenario $S_3$. Only when the robber is caught and confesses having killed the victim (evidence $E_3$)---possibly much later, it becomes clear what has happened. The body found $E_0$ and the confession $E_3$ are relevant for answering the legally relevant questions who killed the victim and why. The other evidence considered, the DNA match $E_1$ and the use of the bank card $E_2$, have played a relevant role in the investigation, but do not support or contradict robbery murder scenario $S_2$.

\subsection{Arguments}
\label{sec:coh-arg}

An analysis of a case in terms of arguments can become complex. When \citet{wigmore1913} developed his charting method 
for analyzing the evidence in a criminal case, %~\citep{wigmore1913}, 
he was well aware of this complexity. 
Figure~\ref{fig:wigmore} provides %an example of 
a Wigmore diagram of %that analyzes  
%Here Wigmore has analyzed 
the murder case \textit{Commonwealth v.\ Umilian} (1901). 
%Jedrusik, the victim, was the author of a letter in which he falsely advised a priest that Umilian had a wife and children (back in the country from which they emigrated), conflicting with Umilian’s intention to marry. In the chart, Z stands for the charge that Umilian killed Jedrusik. The node at 8 represents a revengeful murderous emotion toward Jedrusik. At 18, it is represented that the marriage is in the end performed, reducing his feelings of revenge. This claim is supported by the (unspecified) evidence at 18.1.
 The diagram for this relatively simple case already contains some two dozen nodes. 
 Diagrams for more complex cases contain many more nodes.
 
 Given an argumentative analysis of a complex case, one would like to know which conclusions follow, and which don't. 
  Here we describe three sources of complexity in the analysis
  of cases from the argumentation perspective: arguments and sub-arguments; attacks, counterattacks and chains of attacks;
  conflicts between reasons and their resolution.
  
  
  
 
 

\begin{figure}[bt]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{img/wigmore.jpg}
\caption{A Wigmore chart\label{fig:wigmore}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The evaluation of an argument can depend on its subarguments.} %
%We already discussed how arguments consisting of conflicts of reasons can be evaluated in this sense, when we discussed the role of exceptions, preferences and weighing (Section~\ref{sec:valueArgs}). 
The structure of a complex argument influences its evaluation, and in particular, the subarguments of a larger argument determine the evaluation of the whole. 
For example, consider the argument in Figure~\ref{fig:arg2} (page~\pageref{fig:arg2}). This can be analyzed as consisting of two subarguments.
The first is that the witness testimony supports the intermediate conclusion 
that the suspect was at the crime scene. This intermediate conclusion, in turn, supports the conclusion that 
the suspect committed the crime, and this is the second subargument. If the first subargument is successfully attacked by a counterargument alleging that the witness is lying,  
the subargument supporting the intermediate conclusion that the suspect was at the crime scene breaks down and its conclusion no longer follows. %Since its subargument breaks down, so does the larger argument. 
Since the subargument does not successfully support the intermediate conclusion, also the larger argument for the final conclusion does not successfully support its conclusion.

\paragraph{The evaluation of an argument can depend on chains of attacks.} %When an argument is successfully attacked, it no longer successfully supports its conclusion. 
Besides the modular relationship between arguments and sub-arguments, a further source of complexity in the analysis of 
arguments is that attacks can be chained. An attack against an argument can be countered by a further attack. When an attack is countered by a further attack, 
the original argument can be reinstated, in the sense that it again successfully supports its conclusion. Figure~\ref{fig:reinstatement} shows an example. A first witness, witness $A$, testifies that the suspect was at the crime scene. This testimony successfully 
supports the conclusion that the suspect was at the crime scene. However, suppose a second witness, witness B, claims that A is lying. 
The claim by witness B attacks the original argument, and thus 
the conclusion that the suspect was at the crime scene is no longer supported. But if a third witness, witness C, claims that B is lying, 
the attack by B against A is countered. Witness B is no longer believable, so there is no reason to conclude that  A is lying. As a result, A's testimony can 
again support the conclusion that the suspect was at the crime scene, and the original argument is thus reinstated. 

\paragraph{Conflicts between reasons can be addressed by exceptions, preferences and weighing.} 
Another source of complexity in the analysis of arguments are conflicts between reasons. 
Reasons may support a certain conclusion or oppose it.
When the same conclusion is supported by a reason (or set of reasons) 
and opposed by another reason (or set of reasons),
different reasons come into conflict. Since a conclusion cannot 
be both supported and opposed, the question arises of how to address and resolve conflicts between reasons. 
%The counterarguments to a reason that result from asking critical questions give rise to conflicts between reasons. 
%Sometimes conflicts of reasons can be resolved in the sense that it can be determined which conclusions follow from the conflicting reasons. 
We distinguish three ways in which conflicts between reasons can be addressed. 

%In the first kind of addressing conflicts between reasons, 
First, if a reason supports a conclusion and another reason opposes it, the conflict between them can be resolved if an exception exists which 
excludes one of the reasons. For instance, suppose two witnesses, A and B, make conflicting statements about 
whether the suspect was at the crime scene. If there is evidence that one witness is lying, 
the conflict is resolved in favor of the witness against whom there is no evidence of lying. 
If there is evidence that witness B is lying, 
the conflict is resolved in favor of A's testimony (see the top of Figure~\ref{fig:conflicts}). %The exception, in this case,

\end{figure}

In the second way of addressing a conflict between reasons, there is again a reason for a conclusion 
and a reason against the same conclusion. This time the resolution of the conflict
occurs not by excluding one of the two reasons, but rather, by giving preference to one reason over the other.
If two witnesses give conflicting testimonies about whether the suspect was at the crime scene, 
%this is an example of rebutting (Section~\ref{sec:confArg}). 
the conflict will remain unresolved insofar as the 
two reasons oppose one another and are assigned equal weight. % (see the middle of Figure~\ref{fig:conflicts}). 
Taking into account further information that can justify preferring one 
reason over the other will resolve the conflict. A reason can be preferred over another, for instance, when it is stronger. 
A preference (indicated by the $>$-sign in Figure~\ref{fig:conflicts}) 
can be justified if one witnesses is shown to be more reliable than the other. In this case, the conclusion that 
follows from the testimony by the more reliable witness should be drawn, while the conclusion that follows from the other, weaker 
testimony should not be drawn. This resolves the conflict. 

The third way of addressing conflicts between reasons involves 
more than two conflicting reasons. For instance, there can be more 
than two witnesses, offering conflicting testimonies (Figure~\ref{fig:conflicts}, bottom). %In the figure, 
%For example, both sides are supported by two witness reports. 
Resolving such conflicts can be thought of as 
weighing the reasons involved, where the weighing of reasons 
is done by generalizing a preference ordering of reasons to an ordering of sets of conflicting reasons. 
%Again, it is concluded that the suspect was not at the crime scene, given this resolution of this conflict of reasons.

\subsection{Probability}

The probability calculus provides formal rules for the coherent interpretation of the evidence. We begin by discussing an elementary application of Bayes' 
theorem when only one piece of evidence is involved, and then turn to an analysis that involves more than one piece of evidence. %more complex cases. 
We briefly 
discuss Bayesian networks, formal and computational tools for handling complex bodies of evidence in the probabilistic setting. 







%\paragraph{The likelihood ratio formula shows how new evidence changes the odds of a hypothesis.} 

\paragraph{The likelihood ratio formula shows how to find the posterior odds given the evidence.} 
The odds of a hypothesis $H$ are given by the ratio $\Pr(H)/\Pr(\neg H)$ of the probability of the hypothesis and the probability of its negation. 
The odds $\Pr(H)/\Pr(\neg H)$ of the hypothesis, unconditioned on the evidence, 
are called the \emph{prior odds} of the hypothesis, and the odds $\Pr(H | E)/\Pr(\neg H | E)$ of the hypothesis, 
conditioned on evidence $E$, are called the \emph{posterior odds}. %\endnote{On the distinction between priors and posteriors, see note \ref{conditioning}.}
%\endnote{See footnote \ref{footnote:prior}.} 
%By Bayes' theorem (Section~\ref{sec:normfram:prob}), 
The latter can 
be found by multiplying the prior odds with the likelihood ratio: 

	\[ \frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H | E)} = \frac{\Pr(E | H)}{\Pr(E| \neg H)}\cdot \frac{\Pr(H)}{\Pr(\neg H)}.\endnote{To derive the likelihood ratio formula, 
	one first applies Bayes' theorem to both $H$ and $\neg H$. We get $\Pr(H|E) = \Pr(E|H)\cdot\Pr(H)/\Pr(E)$ and $\Pr(\neg H|E) = \Pr(E|\neg H)\cdot\Pr(\neg H)/\Pr(E)$. Using these, we find:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H|E)}
=
\frac{\Pr(E|H)\cdot\Pr(H)/\Pr(E)}
{\Pr(E|\neg H)\cdot\Pr(\neg H)/\Pr(E)}
=
\frac{\Pr(E|H)\cdot\Pr(H)}
{\Pr(E|\neg H)\cdot\Pr(\neg H)},
\end{equation*}

\noindent proving the likelihood ratio formula.}\]

\noindent 
This formula shows that the (incremental) evidential value of the evidence for a hypothesis, expressed by the likelihood ratio $\frac{\Pr(E | H)}{\Pr(E| \neg H)}$, 
does not by itself give the posterior odds. The prior odds are needed as well. % too. 
%As such, the likelihood ratio is a constraint that must be obeyed in a coherent interpretation of the evidence concerning a hypothesis.
If the posterior odds $\frac{\Pr(E|H)}{\Pr(E|\neg H)}$ are known, 
the \textit{posterior probability} $\Pr(H|E)$ can be derived by applying the following formula:
%
\[\Pr(H|E) = \frac{\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H|E)}}{1+ \frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H|E)}}.\endnote{$\Pr(H|E)=\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(H|E)+\Pr(\neg H|E)}=\frac{\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H|E)}}{\frac{\Pr(H|E)+\Pr(\neg H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H|E)}}=\frac{\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H|E)}}{\frac{\Pr(H|E)}{\Pr(\neg H|E)}+1}$.}
\]
%

\noindent Consider an example. The incremental evidential value of a DNA match, call it $M$, relative to the hypothesis 
that the defendant is factually guilty, call it $G$, is given by  the likelihood ratio $\frac{\Pr(M |G)}{\Pr( M | \neg G)}$. 
Suppose this ratio is assigned a numerical value, as follows:
%
\[\frac{\Pr(M |G)}{\Pr( M | \neg G)}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2,000,000}}=2, 000,000.\]
% 
Suppose, also, that the prior odds are as follows:
%
\[\frac{\Pr(G)}{\Pr(\neg G)}=\frac{\frac{1}{\text{200,000}}}{\frac{199,999}{200,000}}\approx \frac{1}{200,000}.\]
% 
The posterior odds of the hypothesis given the match $\frac{\Pr(G|M)}{\Pr(\neg G|M)}$ are therefore as follows:
%
\[\frac{\Pr(G|M)}{\Pr(\neg G|M)}= \frac{\Pr(M |G)}{\Pr( M | \neg G)}\cdot \frac{\Pr(G)}{\Pr(\neg G)} \approx 2,000,000 \cdot \frac{1}{200,000}=20.\]
% 
So the poster probability of the hypothesis is as follows:
%
\[\Pr(G|M)= \frac{\frac{\Pr(G|M)}{\Pr(\neg G|M)}}{1+ \frac{\Pr(G|M)}{\Pr(\neg G|M)}} \approx \frac{20}{1+20}\approx 95\%.\]
%
 


\paragraph{A generalization of the formula shows 
how to handle more pieces of evidence.} 
So far we have considered only one piece of evidence. 
%The likelihood ratio formula to more than one piece of evidence, the posterior odds are found by the repeated multiplication of the likelihood ratios of the individual pieces of evidence. 
In a straightforward generalization of the formula for two pieces of evidence $E_1$ and $E_2$, the likelihood ratios of the individual pieces of evidence are multiplied, as follows:
	\[ \frac{\Pr(H|E_1 \land E_2)}{\Pr(\neg H | E_1 \land E_2)} = 
	\frac{\Pr(E_2 | H)}{\Pr(E_2| \neg H)}
	\cdot 
	\frac{\Pr(E_1 | H)}{\Pr(E_1| \neg H)}
	\cdot 
	\frac{\Pr(H)}{\Pr(\neg H)}.\]
%\noindent Appealing as it is, this naive generalization is false in general and does not hold in the probability calculus. 
However, this generalization only holds provided that the two pieces of evidence are 
independent conditional on the hypothesis, that is, $\Pr(E_2| H)=P(E_2| H \wedge E_1)$. 
%(More on this below.) 

To illustrate, consider now two pieces of evidence: a DNA match and a witness testimony.
The DNA match, call it $M$, holds between the crime traces and the defendant, and 
the witness, call it $W$, in her testimony asserts that the defendant was 
seen at the crime scene. 
Both pieces of evidence, intuitively, support the hypothesis $G$ that the defendant 
is factually guilty. To assign an explicit numerical value, assume
 the DNA match has a likelihood ratio $\frac{\Pr(M | G)}{\Pr( M | \neg G)}$ of 2 million, 
and the witness testimony a likelihood ratio $\frac{\Pr(W | G)}{\Pr( W | \neg G)}$ of 1,000. 
These numbers are purely illustrative, but are needed to perform the probabilistic calculations. (Of course, there remains the 
question of how the numbers can be obtained and whether the numbers 
needed to carry out the calculations are available in the first place. This is a topic of debate.) Finally, assume the two 
pieces are independent conditional on the hypothesis $G$, that is, 
$\Pr(W|G)=\Pr(W| G\wedge M)$. 

The combined (incremental) evidential value of the two pieces of evidence is given by multiplying the two likelihood 
ratios, that is, $2,000,000\times 1,000=2,000,000,000$, which is a higher value 
than the two pieces considered independently. 
If the prior odds $\frac{\Pr(G)}{\Pr(\neg G)}$ are roughly $\frac{1}{200,000}$
as before, the posterior odds are therefore as follows:
%
\[\frac{\Pr(G|M\wedge W)}{\Pr(\neg G|M\wedge W)}= \frac{\Pr(M |G)}{\Pr( M | \neg G)}\cdot \frac{\Pr(W |G)}{\Pr( W | \neg G)}\cdot \frac{\Pr(G)}{\Pr(\neg G)} \approx 2,000,000 \cdot 1,000 \cdot \frac{1}{200,000}= 20,000.\]
% 
So the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the two pieces of evidence is as follows:
%
\[\Pr(G|M\wedge W) \approx \frac{20,000}{1+20,000}\approx 99\%.\]
%
Compare this probability with $\Pr(G|M)$, which 
was 95\%, a lower value. The probability calculus can offer a numerical 
representation of the intuitive fact that two pieces of evidence, taken together, 
have a higher (overall) evidential value than one piece alone. 

 If the two pieces of evidence are not independent, 
the likelihood ratio formula for two pieces of evidence 
takes the following, more general 
form:

	\[ \frac{\Pr(H|E_1 \land E_2)}{\Pr(\neg H | E_1 \land E_2)} = 
	\frac{\Pr(E_2 | H \land E_1)}{\Pr(E_2| \neg H \land E_1)}
	\cdot 
	\frac{\Pr(E_1 | H)}{\Pr(E_1| \neg H)}
	\cdot 
	\frac{\Pr(H)}{\Pr(\neg H)}.\]

\noindent The first generalization follows from the second, assuming 
independence between the two pieces of evidence conditional on the hypothesis of interest. 
The first generalization does not always hold because 
the evidential value of a piece of evidence, as measured by the likelihood ratio, 
can change in the face of other evidence. 
%The problem with the second formula, however, is that it is much more difficult to apply.





%Note how the factor $\Pr(E_2 | H)/P(E_2| \neg H)$ in the naive, incorrect generalization has been replaced by the factor $\Pr(E_2 | H \land E_1)/P(E_2| \neg H \land E_1)$ in the correct generalization.

 %Formally, $\Pr(E_2 | H)/P(E_2| \neg H)$ is in general different from $\Pr(E_2 | H \land E_1)/P(E_2| \neg H \land E_1)$. Evidence can for instance be mutually strengthening. 

% For instance H E1 E2
%         - - -  81
%         - - +   9
%         - + -   9
%         + + +   1
%         Total   100
% E1 and E2 are independent, but mutually strengthening as evidence for H. In fact, LR(E2, H) = 11, LR(E2, H |E1) = infinite. 


\paragraph{%For the combination of multiple pieces of evidence and multiple hypotheses, 
More complex analytic tools can be used, in particular Bayesian networks.} 
Probabilistic analyses become more complex when more elements are involved, 
%Since many realistic crime cases involve many pieces of evidence and several hypotheses, 
%Probabilistic 
and calculations quickly become unmanageable without appropriate modeling tools. 
We discuss Bayesian networks, 
a prominent example of a modeling tool that allows for complex probabilistic 
representations and calculations.
A great strength of Bayesian networks is that, once the 
network structure is in place and the probabilities are assigned, 
many computer programs exist that can perform 
all calculations automatically. 
%In what follows we perform the calculations 
%manually to give a better sense of how a Bayesian 
%network works. 







%Bayesian networks have been proposed in computer science and artificial intelligence, and exploit probabilistic independencies to simplify representations and calculations.

A Bayesian network has a graphical and a numeric part. The graphical part is a directed, acyclic graph of the relevant probabilistic variables. 
Each node in the graph represents a variable---a hypothesis or a piece of evidence---that 
can take the value `true' or `false'. 
Consider, for instance, the Bayesian network in Figure~\ref{fig:BN}. At the top, two hypotheses are shown. One is that the suspect is factually guilty (abbreviated, `Guilt'), and 
the other hypothesis is that the suspect was somewhere else when the crime was committed (abbreviated, `Elsewhere').  %The arrow, in this case, expresses a particular dependency between the hypotheses: when one is true, the other is false, and vice versa. 
At the bottom, two pieces of evidence are shown: security camera footage that incriminates the suspect (abbreviated, `Camera'), and the testimony of the suspect's partner 
who provides an alibi (abbreviated, `Partner'). 
The arrows connecting the nodes indicate dependency relations. %Dependencies are important. By the arrow between them, 
The `Elsewhere' variable has the `Guilt' variable as a parent, and 
%Each piece of evidence depends on a hypotheses, 
each evidence node has a hypothesis as parent. 

Some might wonder how  a Bayesian 
network should be constructed. This is not a trivial task, and there can be different Bayesian 
network models of the same case. For example, 
some might prefer to the Bayesian network in Figure~\ref{fig:BN} a network whose nodes 
are arranged in a slightly different way, or using different variables. 
The construction of a Bayesian 
network for the purpose of evidence assessment is ultimately an art.

\caption{An example Bayesian network: conditional probability tables\label{tab:BN}}
\end{table*}

Turning now to the numeric part of a Bayesian network, this consists of conditional probability tables. In these tables, 
the conditional probabilities of each variable are
specified, conditioned on the different values of the parent variables. %If a variable does not have a parent variable, no conditional
% probability should be specified for that variable. 
Table~\ref{tab:BN}, for example, contains four tables of conditional probabilities, one per variable. 
Consider first the probability assignments in the top two tables. The prior probability of factual guilt 
is set to an arbitrary low value, 0.1\%, or 1 in a 1000 (top left table). 
Since the two hypotheses---`guilt' and `elsewhere'---are assumed to exclude one another, 
it can never occur that they are both true or both false (top right table). Consider now the two bottom tables. 
%The two tables at the bottom specify how the occurrence of the evidence depends on the truth of the hypotheses. 
The bottom left table shows how the camera identification depends on the suspect's factual guilt. If the suspect is factually guilty, 
there is a 70\% probability that the suspect is correctly identified in the security camera footage. 
If the suspect is not factually guilty, this probability is much lower, 1\%. The likelihood ratio $\Pr(\text{Camera} | \text{Guilt})/\Pr(\text{Camera} | \neg \text{Guilt})$ 
expressing the strength of the camera footage evidence relative to hypotheses `guilt' and `not-guilt' 
is therefore 70.
%If the suspect is not guilty, there is a 1\% chance that the suspect is mistakenly 
%identified in security camera footage. If the suspect is instead guilty, there is a 30\% chance that the suspect is not identified, e.g., because he is not recognizable. 
The bottom left table shows how the partner's alibi testimony depends on whether the suspect was in fact elsewhere when the crime was committed. %the truth of the suspect's alibi.
If the `Elsewhere' hypothesis  is true, the partner will surely provide an alibi in favor of the defendant. If the `Elsewhere' hypothesis is false, 
the table specifies that there is a 10\% chance that 
the suspect's partner will still provide an alibi in favor of the defendant. The likelihood ratio $\Pr(\text{Partner} | \text{Elsewhere})/\Pr(\text{Partner} | \neg \text{Elsewhere})$ 
expressing the strength of the evidence (in this case, the partner's testimony providing an alibi) relative to hypotheses `Elsewhere' and `not-Elsewhere' 
is therefore 10.

The question now is how to combine the two pieces of evidence, the incriminating camera footage and the exculpatory partner's alibi testimony, 
and thus how to assess the probability of the defendant's guilt. Multiplying the likelihood 
ratios for each piece of evidence will not do. 
Bayesian networks can be of help here. For illustrative purposes, 
we write down the somewhat tedious calculations, although 
there is software that can do them automatically. 
%but we will write them up for illustrative purposes. %, but computers can also be used instead. 
Now, if the goal is to calculate $\Pr$(Guilt$|$Partner$ \land $Camera)---that is, the conditional probability of guilt given 
both the camera footage and the partner's alibi testimony---we need to calculate both $\Pr$(Partner$ \land $Camera) 
and $\Pr$(Guilt$ \land $Partner$ \land $Camera). 
%Given a Bayesian network, these can be found by chaining conditional probabilities and using the dependencies and independencies represented in the graph. 

$\Pr$(Partner$ \land $Camera) 
can be broken down as the sum of four probabilities. That is, 
\begin{flalign*}
\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera}) &= 
\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera} \land \text{Elsewhere} \land \text{Guilt})\\
&~~~~~+~\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera} \land \text{Elsewhere} \land \neg\text{Guilt})\\
&~~~~~+~\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera} \land \neg\text{Elsewhere} \land \text{Guilt})\\
&~~~~~+~\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera} \land \neg\text{Elsewhere} \land \neg\text{Guilt})
%&= 0+0.00999+0.00007+0=0.01006
\end{flalign*}
%
Let us calculate each in turn. First, we have:
%
\begin{description}
	\item $\Pr$(Partner$ \land $Camera$ \land $Elsewhere$ \land $Guilt)\\
	= $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Camera$ \land $Elsewhere$ \land $Guilt) $\Pr$(Camera$ | $Elsewhere$ \land $Guilt) $\Pr$(Elsewhere$ | $Guilt) $\Pr$(Guilt)\\
	= $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Elsewhere) $\Pr$(Camera$ | $Guilt) $\Pr$(Elsewhere$ | $Guilt) $\Pr$(Guilt) \\
	= 1*0.7*0*0.001 = 0
\end{description}
%
Note that we relied on the equalities 
%
\begin{description}
	\item $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Camera$ \land $Elsewhere$ \land $ Guilt) = $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Elsewhere); and 
	\item $\Pr$(Camera$ | $Elsewhere$ \land$ Guilt) = 	$\Pr$(Camera$ | $ Guilt).
\end{description}
They hold for the Bayesian network because % of the independence 
%relations modeled in the Bayesian network. 
%These independencies follow from the graph of the Bayesian network as 
the node representing the partner's testimony has only 
the `Elsewhere' variable node as a parent, and the `Camera' node only the `Guilt' node.
Given the Bayesian network, 
the `Partner' variable does not depend on the `Camera' or `Guilt' variable, 
and the `Camera' variable does not depend on the `Elsewhere' variable. 
\noindent Second, we have:
%
\begin{description}
	\item $\Pr$(Partner$ \land $Camera$ \land $Elsewhere$ \land \neg$Guilt)\\
	= $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Camera$ \land $Elsewhere$ \land \neg$Guilt) $\Pr$(Camera$ | $Elsewhere$ \land \neg$Guilt) $\Pr$(Elsewhere$ | \neg$Guilt) $\Pr$($\neg$Guilt)\\
	= $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Elsewhere) $\Pr$(Camera$ | \neg$Guilt) $\Pr$(Elsewhere$ | \neg$Guilt) $\Pr$($\neg$Guilt) \\
	= 1*0.01*1*0.999 = 0.00999 %$\approx$ 1\%
\end{description}
%
Note that we relied on the equalities 
%
\begin{description}
	\item $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Camera$ \land $Elsewhere$ \land \neg$Guilt) = $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Elsewhere); and
	\item $\Pr$(Camera$ | $Elsewhere$ \land \neg$Guilt) = 	$\Pr$(Camera$ | \neg$Guilt).
\end{description}
They hold, as before, because of the independence 
relations among variables in the Bayesian network. %, as before.
%These independencies follow from the graph of the Bayesian network as the 
%node representing the partner's testimony has only the alibi variable node as a parent, and the camera node only the guilt node.
%
\noindent Third, we have:
%
\begin{description}
	\item $\Pr$(Partner$ \land $Camera$ \land \neg$Elsewhere$ \land $Guilt)\\
	= $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Camera$ \land \neg$Elsewhere$ \land $Guilt) $\Pr$(Camera$ | \neg$Elsewhere$ \land $Guilt) $\Pr$($\neg$Elsewhere$ | $Guilt) $\Pr$(Guilt)\\
	= $\Pr$(Partner$ | \neg$Elsewhere) $\Pr$(Camera$ | $Guilt) $\Pr$($\neg$Elsewhere$ | $Guilt) $\Pr$(Guilt) \\
	= 0.1*0.7*1*0.001 = 0.00007
\end{description}
Once again, we relied on independence relations. %, in particular, the node 
%representing the partner's testimony has only the alibi variable node as a parent, 
%and the camera node only the guilt node.
%
\noindent Fourth, since `Guilt' and `Elsewhere' cannot both be true, we have: 
%
\begin{description}
	\item $\Pr$(Partner$ \land $Camera$ \land \neg$Elsewhere$ \land \neg$Guilt) = 0
\end{description}
%
\noindent By adding these four probabilities, we find: 
%
\begin{flalign*}
\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera}) &= 
%\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera} \land \text{Alibi} \land \text{Guilt})\\
%&~~~~~+~\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera} \land \text{Alibi} \land \neg\text{Guilt})\\
%&~~~~~+~\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera} \land \neg\text{Alibi} \land \text{Guilt})\\
%&~~~~~+~\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera} \land \neg\text{Alibi} \land \neg\text{Guilt})\\
%&= 
0+0.00999+0.00007+0=0.01006
\end{flalign*}


%We first compute elements of the full probability distribution over the variables. For instance, we have the following:
%\noindent Here the first equality holds by the probability calculus, while the second equality uses independency relations as modeled in the Bayesian network. In particular, we have for this network:
%\begin{description}
%	\item $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Camera$ \land $Alibi$ \land \neg$Guilt) = $\Pr$(Partner$ | $Alibi) 
%	\item $\Pr$(Camera$ | $Alibi$ \land \neg$Guilt) = 	$\Pr$(Camera$ | \neg$Guilt) 
%\end{description}
%\noindent 
%Similarly we can compute 
%the probability that the suspect is guilty and the alibi is false, while the partner testifies for the alibi and he is identified.
%\noindent As the two hypotheses exclude one another, some probabilities are equal to 0:

\noindent Finally, we can compute the guilt probability based on the camera footage and the partner's testimony, as follows:
%
\begin{flalign*}
\Pr(\text{Guilt}~|~\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera})
&=\Pr(\neg\text{Elsewhere}\land\text{Guilt}~|~\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera})\\
&=\frac{\Pr(\text{Partner} \land \text{Camera} \land \neg \text{Elsewhere} \land \text{Guilt})}{\Pr(\text{Partner}
 \land \text{Camera})}\\
&=0.00007/0.01006 \approx 0.7\%
\end{flalign*}
%
The 0.7\% probability is low, but recall that 
the prior guilt probability was lower, 
0.1\%.  Also note that
$\Pr$(Guilt$|$Camera) equals (roughly) 6.5\%.\endnote{Since $\frac{\Pr(\text{Guilt})}{\Pr(\neg \text{Guilt})}=\frac{0.001}{0.999}$  
and $\frac{\Pr(\text{Camera} | \text{Guilt})}{\Pr(\text{Camera} | \neg \text{Guilt})}=70$, by Bayes' theorem, $\frac{\Pr(\text{Guilt} | \text{Camera})}{\Pr(\neg \text{Guilt} \text{Camera})}=\frac{0.001}{0.999}\times 70 \approx 0.07$ and thus
$\Pr$(Guilt$|$Camera)$\approx \frac{0.07}{1+0.07}~\sim~6.5\%$.} This is a low probability, but still greater than 0.7\% or 0.1\%. 
This shows that the camera evidence by itself has incriminating evidential value, as it raises the guilt probability from 0.1\% to 6.5\%. However, when the partner's alibi 
testimony is added as evidence, the support for the guilt hypothesis is weakened to 0.7\%. 

Finally, a note about complexity. For probability functions of many variables that have many dependencies, a Bayesian network representation can be significantly 
more compact than a general full probability distribution over the variables. Our example has four variables, in general requiring 
15 numbers to specify the full distribution. Given the independencies in the network, 
we only need~7 (note that half of the 14 numbers in Table~\ref{tab:BN} are superfluous as they follow from the other half).

%\section{When can we convict?}
\section{Reasoning and decision making}
\label{sec:whenconv}
\label{sec:intexc}

%\subsection{Beyond a reasonable doubt}

So far we have focused on how the evidence can be evaluated and combined. %, and how inferences can be drawn. 
%This does not take place in vacuum. 
%The legal system contains rules for the discovery, admission and exclusion of the evidence. 
%The legal system also contains 
%procedures and guarantees available to defendants. In most countries, for example, criminal defendants enjoy 
%the right to cross examine their accusers and scrutinize the evidence presented against them, and all defendants are 
%presumed innocent until proven guilty. 
%During the dialectical confrontation between two parties, each defending their side of the case, 
%the role of judge is sometimes that of a mere arbiter or an active participant as well. 
But once the evidence has been introduced at trial, examined and cross-examined, it comes a time when the fact finders, either a 
trained judge or a group of lay jurors, must reason from the evidence, reach a conclusion and decide 
whether to convict or acquit the defendant. 
%The decision should be based on the evidence presented 
%and the law governing the case, not human feelings, but this leaves two important questions unanswered. The first is how 
%the reasoning from the evidence to the conclusion should be conducted. The second concerns the appropriate standard that 
%should govern the decision. In continental Europe until the 18th century, an elaborate system of legal arithmetic 
%was in place, dividing legal proofs in full and half proofs and detailing how proofs could be added to one another. REFERENCES. 
%With the Enlightenment, however, free proof gained momentum and the system of legal arithmetic fell in disrepute.
%
%Currently, there is no strict regulation of how the fact finders should reason or 
%reach conclusions on the basis of the evidence. However, 
The decision criterion is defined by law 
and consists of a standard of proof, sometimes also called burden of persuasion. 
%This is not to be confused with the burden of proof, which includes the burden of persuasion as well as the burden of production.
%The standard of proof identifies, in a somewhat verbally imprecise manner, 
%how strong the evidence should be for warranting a finding of criminal liability. Failure to meet the standard of proof must 
%result in an acquittal. 
%The criterion for criminal cases in common law countries is 
%\textit{proof beyond a reasonable doubt}, and a similar criterion exists outside the common law.
 If the decision makers are persuaded of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, 
 they should convict, or else they should acquit. 

%In Commonwealth v.\ Massachusetts Webster (1850), 
%proof beyond a reasonable doubt is equated to 
%`reasonable and moral certainty'. In R.\ v.\ Lifchus (1997), the Supreme Court of Canada writes that 
%the `the standard of proof beyond a reasonable 
%doubt is inextricably intertwined with \dots 
%the presumption of innocence', that it is connected with `the evidence or 
%absence of evidence', and also that `it does not involve proof to an absolute certainty' and so 
%`it is not proof beyond any doubt' (335). 
Paraphrases of the formulation `proof beyond a reasonable doubt' 
abound in the case law. Yet, it is unclear 
whether they improve our understanding. The US Supreme Court might have been right when, in Holland v.\ United States (1954), 348 U.S. 121, 
it wrote that that `attempts to explain the term ``reasonable doubt'' do not result in making it any clearer' (140).
The three frameworks we considered---probability, arguments and narratives---can be supplemented by a decision-theoretic 
layer and then used to characterize the standard of proof, although they are not immune from shortcomings, 
as we shall soon see.

\subsection{Probability}

In a probabilistic treatment, reasoning and decision making are analyzed using the probability calculus combined with elements of decision theory.
\paragraph{The guilt probability is assessed by weighing the evidence with the probability calculus.}

 On the probabilistic framework, the goal is to assess the probability of the defendant's guilt based 
 on all the available evidence. The assessment begins with a relatively low value 
for the guilt probability, prior to considering any evidence. After all, absent any incriminating evidence, the prior 
probability that an individual committed a crime should be rather low. 
As more evidence is presented, the guilt probability 
moves upwards or downwards depending on whether the evidence is incriminating or exculpatory. 
When all the evidence is considered, a final guilt probability value is 
reached. This forms the basis for 
the decision to convict or acquit. 

The value of the guilt probability is arrived at by applying Bayes' theorem a 
repeated number of times and by plugging the values of the probabilities that are needed. 
Sometimes these probabilities can be %are known because they are 
based on numerical data about population proportions, as in the case of DNA evidence, 
but often %sometimes 
data are not available. For example, $\Pr(G)$ is required to calculate $\Pr(G|E)$ using Bayes' theorem, where  
$\Pr(G)$ is the probability of the defendant's guilt regardless of the evidence 
presented at trial. What probability value should be assigned to $\Pr(G)$? 
%For technical reasons, it cannot be zero, but it also cannot be 50\% because 
%of the presumption of innocence. Arguably, $\Pr(G)$ should be relatively low, but how low?
It is subject to debate how to assess this probability, and 
even whether it makes sense to assign a number to the prior probability  of guilt 
in the first place.


\paragraph{The decision criterion is a guilt probability threshold.}

In probabilistic terms, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt means 
that the defendant's \textit{probability of guilt}, given the evidence presented at trial, meets a 
threshold, say, $>$99\% or $>$99.9\%. 
%Consequently, a 
%doubt would be reasonable or unreasonable depending on a measurable probability. 
%
A numerical value for the threshold can be identified using expected utility theory. 
Let $c(CI)$ be the cost of convicting an innocent and $c(AG)$ the cost 
of acquitting a guilty defendant. For a conviction to be justified, the 
expected cost of convicting an innocent must be lower than the expected 
cost of acquitting an innocent, that is, 
%
\[ \Pr(G|E) \cdot c(AG) > [1-\Pr(G|E)] \cdot c(CI) .\]
%
%The inequality represents a situation in which the expected cost resulting from convicting an innocent is lower than the expected cost
%resulting from a cutting a guilty defendant. Given the inevitable possibility of error, such a situation would be one in which 
%convicting is less costly than acquitting, so convicting is justified. Crucially, 
The inequality holds just in case 
%
\[ \frac{\Pr(G|E)}{1- \Pr(G|E)} > \frac{c(CI)}{c(AG)}.\]
%
%This formula gives a precise indication of how high the probability 
%of guilt must be to justify a guilty verdict, relative to the ratio between $D_i$ and $D_g$. 
%If we consider thatthe disutility of convicting an innocent is as harmful as the disutility of acquitting an innocent, 
%i.e., $D_g=D_i$---as it might be the case in a civil case---, the lower bound for $P_g$ must be at least $\frac{1} {2}$. 
Suppose $ \frac{c(CI)}{c(AG)}=\frac{99}{1}$, as might be more appropriate in a criminal 
case in which the conviction of an innocent defendant is regarded as far worse than the acquittal of a guilty defendant.
Then, the inequality hold only if $\Pr(G)$ meets the threshold 99\%.
More complicated models are also possible, but the basic idea is that the probability 
required for a conviction is a function of weighing the 
costs that would result from an erroneous decision. 

%MENTION PROOF PARADOXES HERE. 

\paragraph{It is not obvious how to assess all the required probabilities.}

The characterization of a decision criterion in terms of a probabilistic threshold is elegant, but its application in practice can be problematic. 
If a probabilistic threshold is understood as a criterion which the decision makers 
 should mechanically apply whenever they confront the decision to convict or acquit, two difficulties arise. The first difficulty is that assigning 
 a probability value to guilt itself might not be feasible. As seen earlier, the starting probability $\Pr(G)$ cannot be easily determined, 
and even if it could, other probabilities might be hard to assess. One solution here is that instead 
 of aiming for a unique guilt probability, we can simply aim for an interval of admissible probabilities given the evidence. 
 More generally, the assessment of the probability of guilt can be viewed as an idealized process, 
 a regulative ideal which can improve the precision of legal reasoning. 
%In this spirit, setting a probabilistic criterion for criminal convictions would only be a way 
%to theorize about the meaning and ideal of the criminal standard of proof. 

Another problem with the probabilistic characterization 
is that it does not take into account the so-called weight of the evidence, that is, whether the evidence presented at trial contains all the evidence 
in the case or just a partial subset of the evidence. The guilt probability will vary dramatically 
depending on the evidence that is used to assess it. It is tempting to suggest that the guilt probability must be based on a body 
of evidence that is complete, or at least as complete as reasonably possible. And yet, it is unclear how to characterize this notion.
No body of evidence is, strictly speaking, complete because new evidence could always be discovered and added.

\subsection{Arguments}

In an argumentative treatment, reasoning and decision making are analyzed in terms of the arguments that are collected.

\paragraph{Supporting and attacking reasons are collected and weighed.}

In a court of law, the prosecutor puts forward a conclusion and offers supporting reasons. The opposing side responds by offering attacking reasons. 
The dialectical process can be complex. As seen earlier, there are different attacking reasons: undermining, undercutting and rebutting. The process is complex also because 
it can be iterated. A conclusion can be attacked by an attacking reasons, and the latter in turn can be attacked. And so on. 
When the dialectical process reaches an equilibrium point and the opposing parties have nothing more to contribute, 
the status of a claim and its supporting reasons can be assessed. 

On the argument based framework, the goal is to consider all the available reasons, by representing them in a comprehensive argumentation graph that 
keeps track of the relations of support and attack. The two competing theories of the cases, the prosecutor's and the defense's theory, will each
be supported by a set of reasons. The argument framework, through the aid of argument graphs, allow us to 
compare the relative strength of the reasons in favor of one side of the case or the other. This comparison of the two sides 
forms the basis for the trial decision.


\paragraph{Defeating attacking arguments is the criterion for meeting the standard of proof.}

In order to establish the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, 
all the attacks against the conclusion that the defendant is guilty must be 
defeated. Now, whether an attack is defeated 
is not always an all or nothing affair. It is often a matter of degrees. 
If the reasons for guilt are slightly stronger than all their attacks, this would not be enough yet. 
To meet the demands of the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the supporting reasons must be significantly 
stronger than all their attacks. On the other hand, defeating all the attacks with absolute certainty would be too much to expect. 
So, more realistically, all attacks must be defeated in an almost definitive way. Perhaps, we need 
to reintroduce some threshold, even though not in an explicitly probabilistic or numerical way. 


\paragraph{It is not obvious when to stop collecting supporting and attacking reasons.}


The argumentation framework is rather realistic. The idea that meeting the standard of proof requires to answer all 
attacks against the conclusion that the defendant is guilty 
is natural enough. A problem is that if the opposing party puts forward no attacks, meeting the standard of proof would be effortless. 
A possible response here is that the attacks must be all the attacks which a reasonable objector could in principle put forward, not just 
the attacks that in fact are put forward. %Here again we see we must recourse to some dose of idealization or abstraction. 
But who is this 'reasonable objector'?

Another problem consists in identifying the threshold. While the probability based account can identify a specific probability threshold, 
at least in theory, by applying the principle of expected utility theory, the argumentation based framework cannot. 
How could expected utility theory be applied to the argument framework, as well?

\subsection{Scenarios}

In a scenarios treatment, reasoning and decision making are analyzed by comparing the different scenarios.

\paragraph{Competing scenarios are collected and compared.}

On the narrative framework, the two parties will put forward competing scenarios, at least two or possibly more than two. This is partly problematic because in a criminal case, the defense does not have the burden of proof. So it might well be that the defense puts forward a scenario that weakens the prosecutor's scenario, but that is not 
a scenario that proves innocence. Be that as it may, the various competing scenarios will be evaluated along the different criteria we identified, such as, consistency with the evidence, explanatory power, plausibility, coherence, etc. The question arises, which scenario should be selected among the competitors?



\paragraph{The best explanatory scenario is the rule of decision.}

We can picture the process of evaluation of the competing scenarios as a process of elimination. 
At the beginning, several scenarios are viable, but as more evidence is considered and the scrutiny of each scenario continues,
fewer scenarios will survive. The goal would be to select one scenario, or at least a limited set of scenarios, so that 
the answer to the question `guilty or not?' would be univocal. On this picture, a scenario meets the demands of the standard 
of proof whenever it is the \textit{only} scenario left.

But, once again, we confront a recurrent problem. The selection of a scenario is not always an all-or-nothing affair.
The term `abduction' or the expression `inference to the best explanation' is sometimes used in this context. The basic idea is that, when confronted 
with two or more competing scenarios, the best explanation must be chosen. The notion of `best explanation' here is wide ranging. It includes criteria such as 
consistency with the evidence, explanatory power (predictive power and causal fit), plausibility, completeness, coherence (temporal and causal structure). 
Other criteria might also play a role, such as the simplicity of the scenario. The best explanation is the scenario that fares 
best on some combination of these criteria. %This is a matter of degrees. The scenarios get higher or lower scores relative to the applicable evaluation criteria. 
In this background, the decision rule would stipulate that 
the best explanatory scenario %that gets the best score %, and that 
%meets a suitable threshold level, 
should be selected. 


\paragraph{It is not obvious how to identify the scenarios and how to compare them.}

The process of scenario analysis and selection resembles how jurors reason in trial proceedings, whereas---in contrast---%despite its 
%clear mathematical underpinnings, 
it is hard to relate probability to judicial proceedings: jurors do not 
naturally quantify guilt, and it can be difficult to quantify it even if we wanted to. Still, a problem with the scenario approach is that 
the method by which scenarios are identified and selected is not entirely transparent. When are all relevant scenarios identified? Should all scenarios mentioned in trial be taken into account, even when they seem far-fetched? Also the different criteria, such as consistency, explanatory power, coherence etc.\ 
can pull the decision makers in opposite directions. For example, a scenario might be better in terms of explanatory power, while another might 
be more plausible. What to do, then? Perhaps a criterion for selecting the best scenario would ultimately be a qualitative version of selecting the most probable scenario, connecting a scenario-based approach with a probabilistic perspective.

\section{Summary and conclusion}

We have discussed evidential reasoning in the law. For this, we have distinguished three normative frameworks: one focusing on the arguments for and against the positions taken; the second using probabilities to assess the evidential value of the evidence; and the third considering the scenarios that best explain the evidence. 

We discussed four main themes: conflicting evidence; evidential value; the coherent interpretation of the evidence; and reasoning and decision making. For each theme, we discussed how they can be addressed in each of the three frameworks. We now summarize our discussion for each theme, using the highlighted phrases in the preceding sections.

\subsection*{Conflicting evidence}

\paragraph{Arguments}

Three kinds of attack can be distinguished: rebutting, undercutting and undermining.
Three kinds of support can be distinguished: multiple, subordinated and coordinated.
Arguments can involve complex structures of supporting and attacking reasons.

\paragraph{Scenarios}

There may be conflicting scenarios about what has happened.
Evidence can be explained by one scenario, but not by another.
Scenarios can be contradicted by evidence.

\paragraph{Probabilities}

Support can be characterized as ``probability increase'' or ``positive likelihood ratio''.
Attack can be characterized as ``probability decrease'' or ``negative likelihood ratio''.
The conflict between two pieces of evidence can be described probabilistically.

\subsection*{Evidential value}

\paragraph{Probabilities}

The incremental evidential value is measured by probabilistic change.
The overall evidential value is measured by the overall conditional probability. 
The use of evidence with high incremental evidential value has complications.
	
\paragraph{Arguments}

The reasons used can be conclusive or defeasible.
Arguments can be evaluated by asking critical questions.
It can be subject to debate whether a reason supports or attacks a conclusion.
	
\paragraph{Scenarios}

Scenarios can be plausible and logically consistent.
The more evidence a scenario can explain, the better.
The more pieces of evidence a scenario is consistent with, the better.
	
\subsection*{Coherently interpreting the evidence}

\paragraph{Scenarios}

Scenarios are coherent clusters 
of events, ordered in time and with causal relations.
Scenarios can be more or less complete.
Weaker scenarios can be better supported by the evidence.
	
\paragraph{Arguments}
The evaluation of an argument can depend on its subarguments.
The evaluation of an argument can depend on chains of attacks.
Conflicts between reasons can be addressed by exceptions, preferences and weighing.
	
\paragraph{Probabilities}

The likelihood ratio formula shows how to find the posterior odds given the evidence.
A generalization of the formula shows how to handle more pieces of evidence.
%For the combination of multiple pieces of evidence and multiple hypotheses, 
More complex analytic tools can be used, in particular Bayesian networks.

\subsection*{Reasoning and decision making}

\paragraph{Probabilities}

The guilt probability is assessed by weighing the evidence with the probability calculus.
The decision criterion is a guilt probability threshold.
It is not obvious how to assess all the required probabilities.
	
\paragraph{Arguments}

Supporting and attacking reasons are collected and weighed.
Defeating attacking arguments is the criterion for meeting the standard of proof.
It is not obvious when to stop collecting supporting and attacking reasons.	
	
\paragraph{Scenarios}

Competing scenarios are collected and compared.
The best explanatory scenario is the rule of decision.
It is not obvious how to identify the scenarios and how to compare them.
	
%\subsection*{Concluding remarks}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent With the thematic discussion of the three normative frameworks, we have aimed to show how each framework contributes to the understanding of conflicting evidence, evidential value, the coherent interpretation of the evidence, and reasoning and decision making. %In this way, we hope to contribute to the further development of the three frameworks. 
In our perspective, there is no need to choose	 between the frameworks, since each adds to the normative analysis of evidential reasoning. At the same time, there is room for further studies of how the three normative frameworks relate to one another, and how they can be integrated into a unified normative perspective on evidential reasoning.
