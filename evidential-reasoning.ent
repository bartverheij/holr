macro:->Bayes'
theorem
can
be
derived
using
the
definition
of
conditional
probability.
We
have
$\Pr
(E|H)
=
\Pr
(H\land
E)/\Pr
(H)$.
Here
we
use
logical
conjunction
$\land
$
to
write
the
combined
event
$H$
and
$E$.
Hence,
$\Pr
(H\land
E)=\Pr
(E|H)\cdot
\Pr
(H)$.
It
follows
that
$\Pr
(H|E)
=
\Pr
(H
\land
E)/\Pr
(E)
=
\Pr
(E|H)\cdot
\Pr
(H)/\Pr
(E)$,
proving
Bayes'
theorem.

macro:->To
see
why,
recall
that
\[
\frac
{\Pr
(H|E)}{\Pr
(\neg
H
|
E)}
=
\frac
{\Pr
(E
|
H)}{\Pr
(E|
\neg
H)}\cdot
\frac
{\Pr
(H)}{\Pr
(\neg
H)},\]
which
implies
\[\frac
{\Pr
(E|H)}{\Pr
(E|\neg
H)}>1
\text
{
iff
}
\frac
{\Pr
(H|E)}{\Pr
(\neg
H
|
E)}
>
\frac
{\Pr
(H)}{\Pr
(\neg
H)}.\]
For
one
direction,
if
$\Pr
(H|E)>
P(H)$,
then
$1-
P(H|E)<
1-
P(H)$.
This
means
that
$\frac
{\Pr
(H|E)}{1-
P(H
|
E)}
>
\frac
{\Pr
(H)}{1-
P(H)}$,
and
thus
$\frac
{\Pr
(H|E)}{\Pr
(\neg
H
|
E)}
>
\frac
{\Pr
(H)}{\Pr
(\neg
H)}$.
So,
by
the
equivalence
above,
$\frac
{\Pr
(E|H)}{\Pr
(E|\neg
H)}>1$.
For
the
other
direction,
if
$\frac
{\Pr
(E|H)}{\Pr
(E|\neg
H)}>1$,
then
$\frac
{\Pr
(H|E)}{\Pr
(\neg
H
|
E)}
>
\frac
{\Pr
(H)}{\Pr
(\neg
H)}$,
again
by
the
equivalence
above.
The
latter
is
the
same
as
$\frac
{\Pr
(H|E)}{1-
P(H
|
E)}
>
\frac
{\Pr
(H)}{1-
P(H)}$.
To
establish
$\Pr
(H|E)>
P(H)$,
suppose
for
contradiction
that
$\Pr
(H|E)
\leq
P(H)$,
which
implies
$1-
P(H|E)
\geq
1-
P(H)$.
This
means
that
$\frac
{\Pr
(H|E)}{1-
P(H
|
E)}
\leq
\frac
{\Pr
(H)}{1-
P(H)}$.
This
contradicts
$\frac
{\Pr
(H|E)}{1-
P(H
|
E)}
>
\frac
{\Pr
(H)}{1-
P(H)}$,
and
thus
$\Pr
(H|E)>
P(H)$.

macro:->To
derive
the
likelihood
ratio,
one
first
applies
Bayes'
theorem
to
both
$H$
and
$\neg
H$.
We
get
$\Pr
(H|E)
=
\Pr
(E|H)\cdot
\Pr
(H)/\Pr
(E)$
and
$\Pr
(\neg
H|E)
=
\Pr
(E|\neg
H)\cdot
\Pr
(\neg
H)/\Pr
(E)$.
Using
these,
we
find:
\par
\begin
{equation*}
\frac
{\Pr
(H|E)}{\Pr
(\neg
H|E)}
=
\frac
{\Pr
(E|H)\cdot
\Pr
(H)/\Pr
(E)}
{\Pr
(E|\neg
H)\cdot
\Pr
(\neg
H)/\Pr
(E)}
=
\frac
{\Pr
(E|H)\cdot
\Pr
(H)}
{\Pr
(E|\neg
H)\cdot
\Pr
(\neg
H)},
\end
{equation*}
\par
\noindent
proving
the
likelihood
ratio
formula.
